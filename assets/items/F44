When you are attacked by such evil inspirations, you may offer a two-unit prayer and pray Almighty Allah to protect you against so.”\r\n\r\nImam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: When Prophet Adam (a.s.) complained to Almighty Allah against evil self-inspirations, Archangel Gabriel came down to him and asked him to say the following:\r\n\r\n--لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ۔--Once Prophet Adam (a.s.) did, he could get rid of evil self-inspirations.\r\n\r\nImam al-Baqir (a.s.) has reported that when a man complained to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) against obsession, evil self-inspiration, and unbearable debts, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) taught him the following litany:\r\n\r\n--تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى الْحَىِّ الَّذِىْ لَايَمُوْتُ وَ الْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ شَرِيْكٌ فِى الْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ وَلِىٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلِّ وَ كَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيْرًا۔--After some time, the man returned to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) to tell him that Almighty Allah had removed obsession from him, helped him settle all his debts, and saved him from poverty.\r\n\r\nThe following holy verse is reported to be said for fending off Satan’s evil inspiration when doubt is arisen in one’s mind:\r\n\r\n--هُوَ الْاَوَّلُ وَالْاٰ خِرُ وَالظَّاهِرُ وَالْبَاطِنُ وَ هُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيْمٌ۔",
