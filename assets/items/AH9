    "content": "There are two types of common forms of ziyarah. The first is said to each Imam independently.\r\n\r\nThe sublime Shaykh Ja’far ibn Muhammad ibn Qawlawayh al-Qummi has reported in his book of Kamil al-Ziyarah that Imam ‘Ali al-Naqi (al-Hadi) instructed to say the following form of ziyarah for each of the two Imams (i.e. al-Kazim and al-Jawad) separately:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَلِيَّ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حُجَّةَ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا نُوْرَ اللّٰهِ فِيْ ظُلُمَاتِ الْاَرْضِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا مَنْ بَدَا لِلّٰهِ فِيْ شَأْنِهِ اَتَيْتُكَ زَاۤئِرًا عَارِفًا بِحَقِّكَ مُعَادِيًا لِاَعْدَاۤئِكَ مُوَالِيًا لِاَوْلِيَاۤئِكَ فَاشْفَعْ [اشْفَعْ‏] لِيْ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ يَا مَوْلَايَ۔--Actually, this form of ziyarah is highly considered; it has been also reported by al-Saduq, al-Kulayni, and al-Tusi with very little difference.\r\n\r\nThe following are some forms of ziyarah addressed to the two Imams (‘a) altogether.\r\n\r\nAl-Mufid, al-Shahid, and Muhammad ibn al-Mashhadi have said the following:\r\n\r\nWhen visiting the two Imams (‘a) together, you may say the following words after you stop at the holy tomb:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا وَلِيَّيِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا حُجَّتَيِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا نُوْرَيِ اللّٰهِ فِي ظُلُمَاتِ الْاَرْضِ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمَا قَدْ بَلَّغْتُمَا عَنِ اللّٰهِ مَا حَمَّلَكُمَا وَ حَفِظْتُمَا مَا اسْتُوْدِعْتُمَا وَ حَلَّلْتُمَا حَلَالَ اللّٰهِ وَ حَرَّمْتُمَا حَرَامَ اللّٰهِ وَ اَقَمْتُمَا حُدُودَ اللّٰهِ وَ تَلَوْتُمَا كِتَابَ اللّٰهِ وَ صَبَرْتُمَا عَلَى الْاَذٰى فِيْ جَنْبِ اللّٰهِ مُحْتَسِبِيْنِ حَتّٰىۤ اَتَاكُمَا الْيَقِيْنُ اَبْرَاُ اِلَى اللّٰهِ مِنْ اَعْدَاۤئِكُمَا وَ اَتَقَرَّبُ اِلَى اللّٰهِ بِوِلَايَتِكُمَا اَتَيْتُكُمَا زَاۤئِرًا عَارِفًا بِحَقِّكُمَا مُوَالِيًا لِاَوْلِيَاۤئِكُمَا مُعَادِيًا لِاَعْدَاۤئِكُمَا مُسْتَبْصِرًا بِالْهُدَى الَّذِيۤ اَنْتُمَا عَلَيْهِ عَارِفًا بِضَلَالَةِ مَنْ خَالَفَكُمَا فَاشْفَعَا لِيْ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمَا فَاِنَّ لَكُمَا عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ جَاهًا عَظِيْمًا وَ مَقَامًا مَحْمُوْدًا۔--You may then kiss the holy dust (of their graves) and put your right cheek on it. You may then turn to the side of the Imam’s head and say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا حُجَّتَيِ اللّٰهِ فِيۤ اَرْضِهِ وَ سَمَاۤئِهِ عَبْدُكُمَا وَ وَلِيُّكُمَا زَاۤئِرُكُمَا مُتَقَرِّبًا اِلَى اللّٰهِ بِزِيَارَتِكُمَا اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْ لِيْ لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ فِيۤ اَوْلِيَاۤئِكَ الْمُصْطَفَيْنَ وَ حَبِّبْ اِلَيَّ مَشَاهِدَهُمْ وَ اجْعَلْنِيْ مَعَهُمْ فِيْ الدُّنْيَا وَ الْاٰخِرَةِ يَاۤ اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔--You may then offer a two-unit prayer for each Imam and then pray Almighty Allah for anything you wish.\r\n\r\nSHORT FORMS OF ZIYARAH\r\n\r\nThe age in which these short forms of ziyarah were issued was an age of terrible persecution (against the holy Imams); therefore, they used to practice taqiyyah (self-protection by showing pious dissimulation). The Holy Imams (‘a) therefore taught their followers such short forms of ziyarah so as to protect them against the tyrannical rulers of these ages.\r\n\r\nIf a visitor wishes to say a long form of ziyarah, he may say the comprehensive (jami’ah) forms of ziyarah, which will be cited in this book. These comprehensive forms are in fact the best forms of ziyarah addressed to the Holy Imams (‘a). The first of these forms (namely; al-Ziyarah al-Jami’ah al-Kabirah –the Major Comprehensive Form of Ziyarah) is best advisable for the visitors of Imam al-Kazim (‘a), because its report shows some peculiarity to this holy Imam.",

I bear witness that you both conveyed faithfully that which Allah ordered You to convey, safeguarded that which He entrusted with you, decided as lawful all that which Allah has deemed lawful, decided as unlawful all that which Allah has deemed unlawful, carried out the decrees of Allah, recited the Book of Allah, endured harm for the sake of Allah, expecting His reward, until death came upon you. I repudiate your enemies in the presence of Allah and I seek nearness to Allah through declaring loyalty to you both. I have come to you both, visiting you, recognizing your rights, declaring loyalty to your loyalists, showing enmity toward your enemies, acknowledging the true guidance that you both follow, and understanding the deviation (from the right path) of any one who disagrees with you.
