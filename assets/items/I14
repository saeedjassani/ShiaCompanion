They fend off fire, drowning, demolishing, falling into wells, being devoured by a beast, violent death, and all evils that are sent down from the heavens at that day. These words are the ever-abiding, good works as mentioned in the Holy Qur’an.”\r\n\r\nAccording to other authentic chain of authority, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said, “Whoever utters these Four Words of Glorification forty times immediately after every obligatory prayer before he moves from his prayer-place, whatever he asks will be granted to him.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another authentic tradition, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said, “The frequent remembering that Allah, the Exalted, has praiseworthily mentioned within His Glorious Wording is to repeat the following doxology (zikr) thirty times after every obligatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللهِ۔--Al-Qutb al-Rawandi has reported that Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) said to al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib, “May I guide you to a matter that if you do, you will be a true intimate servant of Allah?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you may,” answered al-Bara’.\r\n\r\nThe Imam (a.s.) said, “You may glorify Almighty Allah with the Four Words of Glorification ten times after each prayer. If you do so, one thousand ordeals, one of which is apostasy, will be warded off from you; and one thousand ranks, one of which is being in the vicinity of your Prophet Muhammad(s.a.w.a.), will be hoarded for you for the Hereafter.”\r\n\r\nEleventh: Al-Kulayni reports Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) as saying: Whoever repeats the following supplicatory prayer three times after the obligatory prayer and then asks Almighty Allah, he will be granted what he has asked for:\r\n\r\n--يَا مَنْ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشاۤءُ وَ لَايَفْعَلُ مَا يَشاۤءُ اَحَدٌ غَيْرُهُ۔",
