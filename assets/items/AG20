So, whoever pays him more visits will have a bigger share of goodness; but whoever pays him less visits will have a less share. However, you may exert more efforts to visit him on the blessed occasions, because rewards for righteous deeds are multiplied on these occasions and the angels come down from the heavens to visit him thereon.”\r\n\r\nHowever, I could find a form of ziyarah restricted to these blessed occasions although there is a supplicatory prayer that is recommended to be said on the third of Sha’ban, Imam al-Husayn’s birthday, and reported from the Sacred Side (i.e. Imam al-Mahdi) as one of his signed documents. This supplicatory prayer has been already cited in this book within the recommended deeds on the third of Sha’ban (pp. 614 of Vol. 1).\r\n\r\nVISITING IMAM AL-HUSAYN (‘A) FROM DISTANT PLACES\r\n\r\nIt is also worth mentioning that to visit Imam al-Husayn (‘a) from any place other than Karbala’ brings about abundant reward. To highlight this fact, let us refer to two traditions only, quoted from al-Kafi (by Shaykh al-Kulayni), man-la-yahzuruhul-faqih (by Shaykh al-Saduq), and Tahdhib al-Ahkam (by Shaykh al-Tusi):\r\n\r\nFirst Tradition: Ibn Abi-’Umayr has reported on the authority of Hisham that Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) said, “If you are too remote (to come to Imam al-Husayn’s tomb), you may go up the highest point of your houses, offer a two-unit prayer, and point to our groups while greeting us. If you do so, your act will reach us.”\r\n\r\nSecond Tradition: Hannan ibn Sadir has reported on the authority of his father that Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) once asked his father, “Sadir, do you visit the tomb of al-Husayn (‘a) everyday?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Sadir, “I do not. May Allah accept me as ransom for you.”\r\n\r\n“How antipathetic you are! Do you visit him every week?” Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) asked.\r\n\r\n“No, I do not,” answered Sadir.\r\n\r\n“Do you visit him once a month?” asked the Imam (‘a).\r\n\r\n“No, I do not,” answered Sadir.\r\n\r\n“Do you visit him once a year?” asked the Imam (‘a).\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” answered Sadir, “I do.”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) commented, “Sadir, how antipathetic with al-Husayn (‘a) you are! You should have known that there are two thousand (or one million according to the report mentioned in Tahdhib al-Ahkam and man-la-yahzuruhul-faqih) angels of Almighty Allah who are ceaselessly visiting Imam al-Husayn (‘a) with dusty hair and appearance. What will harm you, O Sadir, if you visit the tomb of al-Husayn (‘a) fives times a week or once a day?”\r\n\r\nSadir answered, “May Allah accept me as ransom for you! Very long distance separates us from Imam al-Husayn’s tomb.”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) instructed, “You can go up the roof of your house, take a look to the right and the left sides, raise your head towards the sky, turn towards the side of Imam al-Husayn’s tomb, and say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَاۤ اَبَا عَبْدِ اللهِ،اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ۔--If you do, you will gain the reward of one time of hajj and one time of ‘umrah.”\r\n\r\nSadir then said, “After this, I kept on doing this form of ziyarah more than twenty times a month.”\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that similar words have been previously mentioned in the first general form of ziyarah.",
