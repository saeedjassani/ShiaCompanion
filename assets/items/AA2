    "content": "In fact, the best of deeds at the nights and on the days of Ramadan is the recitation of the Holy Qur’an. It is thus highly advisable to recite it in this month in a way different from reciting it in the other months, since its revelation was in Ramadan. A Hadith reads that everything has a springtime; and the springtime of the Holy Qur’an is the month of Ramadan. It is recommended to recite the whole Qur’an once a month or once each six days in the other months, according to some narrations. As to the month of Ramadan, it is required to recite it wholly once every three days. If possible, it will be better if it is recited wholly every day. ‘Allamah al-Majlisi has narrated that some of the Holy Imams (a.s.) used to recite the whole Qur’an forty times, or even more, in Ramadan. The reward of reciting the whole Qur’an is doubled when its recitation is dedicated to the souls of the holy fourteen Infallibles (a.s.) by dedicating each recitation to each one of them respectively. According to some narrations, the reward of one who dedicates the recitation of the Holy Qur’an to the Holy Infallibles (a.s.) is that one shall be included with them on the Resurrection Day.\r\n\r\nIt is also advisable to say supplications, offer prayers, implore for Almighty Allah’s forgiveness, and confess His Oneness (by repeating the phrase of la-ilaha illal-lahu –there is no god save Allah-) as much as possible in Ramadan. In this regard, Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-’Abidin (a.s.) used to stop talking in Ramadan except with phrases of prayers, glorification of Almighty Allah, implorations of His forgiveness, and phrases of confessing of His magnificence (i.e. Takbir –saying: Allahu-akbar).\r\n\r\nIt is finally recommended to pay a great interest to the reported acts of worship as well as the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) prayers at nights and days.",
