Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that whoever recites this Surah in his house every night, will be kept safe from Jinnaat and the evil designs of Shaitan.\r\n\r\nIf this Surah is put around the neck of a child as a talisman, the child will be protected from Jinnat. Reciting the Ma’udhatayn before sleeping is a means of safety and if recited on any part of the body that is paining, the pain will be relieved.\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ--قُلْ اَعُوْذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِۙ‏(1)--مَلِكِ النَّاسِۙ‏(2)--اِلٰهِ النَّاسِۙ‏(3)--مِنْ شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ  ۙ الْخَنَّاسِ ۙ‏(4)--الَّذِىْ يُوَسْوِسُ فِىْ صُدُوْرِ النَّاسِۙ‏(5)--مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ‏(6)",
