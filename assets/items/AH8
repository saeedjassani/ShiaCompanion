You may then say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ ۟اِلْاِمَامِ التَّقِيِّ النَّقِيِّ الرَّضِيِّ الْمَرْضِيِّ وَ حُجَّتِكَ عَلٰى مَنْ فَوْقَ الْاَرْضِ وَ مَنْ تَحْتَ الثَّرٰى صَلٰوةً كَثِيْرَةً نَامِيَةً زَاكِيَةً مُبَارَكَةً مُتَوَاصِلَةً مُتَرَادِفَةً مُتَوَاتِرَةً كَاَفْضَلِ مَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلٰىۤ اَحَدٍ مِنْ اَوْلِيَاۤئِكَ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَلِيَّ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا نُوْرَ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حُجَّةَ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا اِمَامَ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ وَ وَارِثَ عِلْمِ النَّبِيِّيْنَ وَ سُلَالَةَ الْوَصِيِّيْنَ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا نُوْرَ اللّٰهِ فِيْ ظُلُمَاتِ الْاَرْضِ اَتَيْتُكَ زَاۤئِرًا عَارِفًا بِحَقِّكَ مُعَادِيًا لِاَعْدَاۤئِكَ مُوَالِيًا لِاَوْلِيَاۤئِكَ فَاشْفَعْ لِيْ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ۔--You may then pray Almighty Allah to grant you your personal needs.\r\n\r\nYou may then offer two prayers with four units under the dome that is over the tomb of Imam al-Jawad (‘a) to the side of his head; a prayer for visiting Imam al-Kazim (‘a) and another prayer for visiting Imam al-Jawad (‘a).\r\n\r\nDo not offer a prayer to the side of Imam al-Kazim’s head, because this side is facing the graves of the people of Quraysh, which is impermissible to be taken as direction of prayer (i.e. kiblah).\r\n\r\nAs understood from the words of Shaykh al-Saduq, the tomb of Imam al-Kazim (‘a) was separated from the tomb of Imam al-Jawad (‘a) by an independent dome and gate. So, visitors used to leave this dome to come under the dome of Imam al-Jawad (‘a), which was thereby an independent building.",
