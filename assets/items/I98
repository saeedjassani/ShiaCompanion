If you invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon me and the prophets who came before me, we all will intercede for you on the Resurrection Day. If you implore Almighty Allah’s forgiveness for the believers, they all will be pleased with you. If you repeat these four doxological statements, you will be decided as having performed hajj and ‘umrah:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ‏ وَ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَ اللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ۔",
