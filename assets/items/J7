Yet, the following form of the supplication has been quoted from Shaykh al-Tusi’s famous book entitled Misbah al-Mutahajjid:\r\n\r\n--لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَ اللهُ اَكْبَرُ وَ سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِيْ لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ شَرِيْكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ وَلِيٌّ مِنَ الذُّلِّ وَ كَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيْرًا--You may then say the following:\r\n\r\n--يَا سَابِغَ النِّعَمِ يَا دَافِعَ النِّقَمِ يَا بَارِئَ النَّسَمِ يَا عَلِيَّ الْهِمَمِ يَا مُغْشِيَ الظُّلَمِ يَا ذَا الْجُوْدِ وَ الْكَرَمِ يَا كَاشِفَ الضُّرِّ وَ الْاَلَمِ يَا مُوْنِسَ الْمُسْتَوْحِشِيْنَ فِي الظُّلَمِ يَا عَالِمًا لَا يُعَلَّمُ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ افْعَلْ بِيْ مَا اَنْتَ اَهْلُهُ يَا مَنِ اسْمُهُ دَوَاۤءٌ وَ ذِكْرُهُ شِفَاۤءٌ وَ طَاعَتُهُ غَنَاۤءٌ [غِنًى‏] اِرْحَمْ مَنْ رَأْسُ مَالِهِ الرَّجَاۤءُ وَ سِلَاحُهُ الْبُكَاۤءُ سُبْحَانَكَ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ يَا حَنَّانُ يَا مَنَّانُ يَا بَدِيْعَ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَ الْاَرْضِ يَا ذَا الْجَلَالِ وَ الْاِكْرَامِ۔--Twenty-Second: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Jumu’ah (No. 62) and Surah al-Munafiqun (No. 63) in the Zohr (noon) Prayer on Fridays and to recite Surah al-Jumu’ah and Surah al-Tawheed in the Asr (afternoon) Prayer.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Saduq has narrated that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said: It is obligatory upon all believers who claim being adherents (Shi’ah) to us (i.e. to the Ahl al-Bayt) to recite Surah al-Jumu’ah and Surah al-A’la (No. 78) in the obligatory prayers at Friday nights and to recite Surah al-Jumu’ah and Surah al-Munafiqun in the Zohr Prayer on Fridays. One who does so will be regarded as following the example of the Holy Messenger, peace be upon him and his Household, and Almighty Allah will award him Paradise.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Kulayni has narrated in a semi-authentic narration that al-Halabi asked Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) whether one should recite the Zohr Prayer audibly on Fridays (in case one cannot attend the congregational Friday Prayer). The Imam (a.s.) answered on the affirmative and confirmed that one should recite Surah al-Jumu’ah and al-Munafiqun in the Zohr Prayer on Fridays.\r\n\r\nTwenty-Third: With reference to the post-prayer litanies in general and the supplications to be said after the Friday Zohr Prayer, Shaykh al-Tusi has quoted Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) as saying: Whoever recites on Friday after the concluding part of the Zohr Prayer the following parts of the Holy Qur’an, will be under the divine protection all over the week:\r\n\r\n(1) Surah al-Faatehah seven times, (2) Surah al-Nas seven times, (3) Surah al-Falaq seven times, (4) Surah al-Tawheed seven times, (5) Surah al-Kafirun seven times, (6) the last two verses of Surah al-Tawbah (No. 9), (7) the final verses of Surah al-Hashr, and (8) the final verses of SurahAl-’Imran.\r\n\r\nTwenty-Fourth: Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: If one says the following supplicatory prayer after the Fajr Prayer or the Zohr Prayer, no sin will be recorded against him for a whole year:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْ صَلَاتَكَ وَ صَلَاةَ مَلَاۤئِكَتِكَ وَ رُسُلِكَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ--Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: If one says the following supplicatory prayer after the Fajr Prayer or the Zohr Prayer (on Fridays), he will not die before he catches the age of Imam al-Mahdi, peace be upon him:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ عَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ۔--The earlier supplication also brings about security from misfortunes up to the next Friday if it is repeated three times after the Friday Zohr Prayer.\r\n\r\nIt has been also narrated that one who invokes Almighty Allah’s blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household, peace be upon them, between the two obligatory Zohr and Asr prayers will have the reward of offering a seventy-unit prayer.\r\n\r\nTwenty-Fifth: It is recommended to say the following two supplications of al-Sahifah al-Sajjadiyyah al-Kamilah:\r\n\r\n---1--«يَا مَنْ يَرْحَمُ مَنْ لَا تَرْحَمَهُ الْعِبَادُ»---2--«اَللّٰهُمَّ هٰذَا يَوْمٌ مُبَارَكٌ»--Then, supplicate as seems proper to you and invoke blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household one thousand times. Thus was Imam Zayn al-’Abidin(a.s.) used to doing.\r\n\r\nTwenty-Sixth: In his book of Misbah al-Mutahajjid, Shaykh al-Tusi says that the Holy Imams, peace be upon them, are reported to have said: When one offers, after the obligatory Zohr Prayer on Fridays, a two-unit prayer reciting in each unit Surah al-Faatehah once and repeating Surah al-Tawheed seven times and after accomplishment says the following supplicatory prayer, one will be saved against all misfortunes and seditious matters up to the next Friday, and will be joined with Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him and his Household, and Prophet Abraham, peace be upon him:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِيْ مِنْ اَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ الَّتِيْ حَشْوُهَا الْبَرَكَةُ وَ عُمَّارُهَا الْمَلَاۤئِكَةُ مَعَ نَبِيِّنَا مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ اٰلِهِ وَ اَبِيْنَا اِبْرَاهِيْمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ۔--Commenting on this supplication, Shaykh al-Tusi instructs that one who is not from the Holy Prophet’s offspring should say, “his father (abihi)” instead of “our father (abina).”",

O Entertainer of those lonely in darkness! O All-knowing Who never needs teaching! (Please) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and do to me all that which befits You.
