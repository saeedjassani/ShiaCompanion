    "content": "Sayyid ‘Abd al-Karim ibn Tawus has reported the following story on the authority of Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Shaybani:\r\n\r\nI was a child when, one day in the year 260 (AH), my father, uncle, and I went out secretly directing to al-Ghari for visiting the tomb of Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a). At that time, the tomb was not constructed but surrounded by black stones. At the time that we were reciting Qur’an, offering prayers, and reciting the Ziyarah form, a lion came in the direction of us. When he approached us, we moved back. The lion came to the tomb and passed its wounded foreleg over it. Fear vanished when we were told about this scene; therefore, we all approached to see the lion, which kept on doing so for a while and then left. We then returned to the tomb.",
