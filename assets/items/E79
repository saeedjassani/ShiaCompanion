    "content": "Sixteenth: Al-Kaf’ami, in his book entitled al-Misbah, and al-Muhaddith al-Fayz, in his book entitled Khulasat al-Adhkar, have said the following:\r\n\r\nIn some books written by Imamiyyah scholars, we have found that whoever wishes to see in dream one of the Prophets, one of the Holy Imams, one of people, or one of his parents, may recite Surah al-Shams (No. 91), Surah al-Layl (No. 92), Surah al-Qadr, Surah al-Kafirun, Surah al-Tawhid, Surah al-Falaq, and Surah al-Nas. Then, he may repeat Surah al-Tawhid one hundred times, repeat the invocation of Allah’s blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household one hundred times, and having performed the ritual ablutions (i.e. wuzu’) sleeps on his right side. If he does, he will see in dream whomever Allah wants him to see and talk with whomever Allah wants him to talk with.\r\n\r\nAccording to another copy, one may do all the previous at seven (successive) nights after saying this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اَنْتَ الْحَىُّ الَّذِىْ لَايُوْصَفُ وَالْاِيْمَانُ يُعْرَفُ مِنْهُ مِنْكَ بَدَتِ الْاَشْيَاۤءُ وَ اِلَيْكَ تَعُوْدُ فَمَاۤ اَقْبَلَ مِنْهَا كُنْتَ مَلْجَاَهُ وَ مَنْجَاهُ وَ مَاۤ اَدْبَرَ مِنْهَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ مَلْجَاۤءٌ وَلَامَنْجًامِنْكَ اِلَّاۤ اِلَيْكَ فَاَسْئَلُكَ بِلَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّاۤ اَنْتَ وَ اَسْئَلُكَ بِبِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ وَ بِحَقِّ حَبِيْبِكَ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ اٰلِهٖ سَيِّدِ النَّبِيِّيْنَ وَ بِحَقِّ عَلِىٍّ خَيْرِ الْوَصِيِّيْنَ وَ بِحَقِّ فَاطِمَةَ سَيِّدَةِ نِسَاۤءِ الْعَالَمِيْنَ وَ بِحَقِّ الْحَسَنِ وَالْحُسَيْنِ اللَّذِيْنَ جَعَلْتَهُمَا سَيِّدَىْ شَبَابِ اَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ عَلَيْهِمْ اَجْمَعِيْنَ السَّلَامُ اَنْ تُصَلِّىَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَنْ تُرِيَنِىْ مَيِّتِىْ فِى الْحَالِ الَّتِىْ هُوَ فِيْهَا--Seventeenth: The author of Khulasat al-Adhkar has also reported the following from some books:\r\n\r\nIn the book entitled al-Akhlaq al-Hamidah and written by Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, I have seen this narration: Harith ibn Rawh has reported on the authority of his father on the authority of his grandfather who said to his sons: If you are attacked by a distressing matter, do not go to sleep before you make sure that your bodies, beds, and blankets are pure. While avoiding sleeping with any woman (i.e. the wife), you may recite Surah al-Shams and Surah al-Layl seven times each. After that, you may say this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْ لِىْ مِنْ اَمْرِىْ هٰذَا فَرَجًا وَ مَخْرَجًا--Once you do so, you will see in your dreams one who guides you how to find a way out from the distressing issue, either at this very night, or the third, or at the fifth (I, the reporter, think that he also added the seventh night).",
