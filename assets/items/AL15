He then said:\r\n\r\nYou may now offer the twelve-unit prayer of ziyarah, separating between each two units with a Taslim statement.\r\n\r\nYou may then say the following supplicatory prayer, which is reported from Imam al-Mahdi (‘a) himself:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ عَظُمَ الْبَلَاۤءُ وَ بَرِحَ الْخَفَاۤءُ وَ انْكَشَفَ الْغِطَاۤءُ وَ ضَاقَتِ الْاَرْضُ وَ مَنَعَتِ السَّمَاۤءُ وَ اِلَيْكَ يَا رَبِّ الْمُشْتَكٰى وَ عَلَيْكَ الْمُعَوَّلُ فِيْ الشِّدَّةِ وَ الرَّخَاۤءِ اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِهِ الَّذِيْنَ فَرَضْتَ عَلَيْنَا طَاعَتَهُمْ فَعَرَّفْتَنَا بِذٰلِكَ مَنْزِلَتَهُمْ فَرِّجْ عَنَّا بِحَقِّهِمْ فَرَجًا عَاجِلًا كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ اَوْ هُوَ اَقْرَبُ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ يَا عَلِيٌّ يَا عَلِيُّ يَا مُحَمَّدُ انْصُرَانِيْ فَاِنَّكُمَا نَاصِرَايَ وَ اكْفِيَانِيْ فَاِنَّكُمَا كَافِيَايَ يَا مَوْلَايَ يَا صَاحِبَ الزَّمَانِ اَلْغَوْثَ الْغَوْثَ الْغَوْثَ اَدْرِكْنِيۤ اَدْرِكْنِيۤ اَدْرِكْنِيْ--This supplicatory prayer is of a high esteem; it is therefore advisable to repeat it in the holy sanctuary of Imam al-Mahdi (‘a) as well as other places. I have previously mentioned it in the first section of the book, yet with little difference is statements.\r\n\r\nSayyid Ibn Tawus has instructed the following:\r\n\r\nYou may offer a two-unit prayer and then say the following words:\r\n\r\n--سَلَامُ اللهِ الْكَامِلُ التَّآمُّ الشَّامِلُ--(Al-Istighathah bi’l-Hujjah.) as quoted from the book of al-Kalim al-Tayyib",
