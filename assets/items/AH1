According to many reports, to visit Imam Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kazim (‘a) is as same as visiting the Holy Prophet (s).\r\n\r\nAccording to another tradition, he who visits Imam al-Kazim (‘a) is as if he has visited the Holy Prophet (s) and Imam ‘Ali Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a).\r\n\r\nAccording to a third tradition, to visit Imam al-Kazim (‘a) is as same as visiting Imam al-Husayn (‘a).\r\n\r\nAccording to a fourth tradition, he who visits Imam al-Kazim (‘a) will have Paradise as reward.\r\n\r\nThe lofty master scholar, Muhammad ibn Shahr’ashub, has quoted in his book of al-Manaqib al-Khatib al-Baghdadi as saying, in his book of Tarikh Baghdad, that ‘Ali ibn Khallal used to say, “Whenever I faced a grieving problem, I would direct to [the tomb of] Musa ibn Ja’far and beg Allah in the name of him to solve it. Hence, Almighty Allah would always relieve that problem.”\r\n\r\n‘Ali ibn Khallal also told this story: In Baghdad, people saw a woman running fast. “Where are you going?” they asked. “I am going to Musa ibn Ja’far, because my son has been led to prison.” Mocking at her, a man of the Hanbali School said to her, “Your son will thus die in the prison!” The woman answered, “I then beseech Allah in the name of the one who was killed in the prison (i.e. Imam al-Kazim) to show me His omnipotence.” So, her son was immediately released and the son of the mocking man was arrested and punished for his felony.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Saduq has reported Ibrahim ibn ‘Aqabah as saying: I wrote a letter to Imam ‘Ali al-Naqi (al-Hadi) asking him about the merits of visiting Imam al-Husayn (‘a) and visiting Imam Musa ibn Ja’far (‘a) and Imam Muhammad al-Taqi (‘a). (i.e. which is more preferred; to visit Imam al-Husayn or to visit Imam al-Kazim and Imam al-Jawad).\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) wrote back, “Visiting Abu-’Abdullah (i.e. Imam al-Husayn) is preferred. Visiting Imam al-Kazim and Imam al-Jawad is more comprehensive and more rewardable.”\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\n\r\nAs for the method and the forms of ziyarah in the holy shrine of Imam al-Kazim and Imam al-Jawad, some forms are shared by the two Imams while others are dedicated to each one separately.",
