    "content": "In his book of al-Najm al-Thaqib, Shaykh al-Nuri, may Allah have mercy upon him, has quoted the story of building the mosque of Jamkaran, a town about five kilometers away from the holy city of Qum, by the command of the Patron of the Age (a.s.). He has thus quoted Imam al-Mahdi(a.s.) as saying to Hasan al-Mathulah of Jamkaran, “Advice people to visit frequently and venerably this place and to offer four units of prayer therein; two units as greeting of the mosque in each unit they should recite Surah al-Faatehah once and repeat Surah al-Tawheed (or al-Ikhlaas) seven times. In the genuflection (ruku') and prostration of this prayer, they may repeat the doxologies of glorifying God seven times. As for the other two-unit prayer, they may dedicate it to Imam al-Mahdi(a.s.). In the first unit, they may recite Surah al-Faatehah, but when they reach this holy verse, they should repeat it one hundred times:\r\n\r\n--اِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَ اِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِيْنُ۔--They may then continue reciting this Surah. The same thing may be done in the second unit. The zikr of glorifying God that are said in the genuflection (ruku') and prostrations of the prayers may be repeated seven times in this prayer. Upon accomplishment of the prayer, they may repeat the tahlil statement (i.e. LA-ILAHA ILLA’LLAHU) one hundred times and then utter the Tasbih al-Zahra’. Immediately after that, they may prostrate themselves and repeat the invocation of blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household one hundred times.” Imam al-Mahdi(a.s.) added, “Whoever offers this prayer will be awarded the reward of offering prayer in the Holy Ka’bah.”",
