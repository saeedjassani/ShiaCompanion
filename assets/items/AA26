    "content": "There are many recommended acts dedicated to this blessed night:\r\n\r\nFIRST: It is recommended to bathe oneself at this night.\r\n\r\nSECOND: It is recommended to visit the holy tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.).\r\n\r\nTHIRD: It is recommended to offer a six unit prayer reciting at each unit Surahs al-Faatehah, Yasin, al-Mulk, and al-Tawheed.\r\n\r\nFOURTH: It is recommended to offer a one hundred unit prayer reciting at each unit Surah al-Faatehah once and repeating Surah al-Tawheed ten times. In al-Muqni’ah, Shaykh al-Mufid has reported Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) as saying, “Whoever offers this prayer, Almighty Allah will appoint for him ten angels protecting him from his human and jinn enemies and will also appoint thirty angels to secure him against Hellfire at the hour of his death.”\r\n\r\nFIFTH: When he was asked about the rewards of one who attends at the holy tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) at the fifteenth night of Ramadan, Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said, “Congratulations be to him! At the fifteenth night of Ramadan, one who attends at the tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) and offers a ten unit prayer after the obligatory Isha’ Prayer other than the Night Prayer (Salat al-Layl), reciting in each unit Surah al-Faatehah once and repeating Surah al-Tawheed ten times, and then seeks Almighty Allah’s protection against Hellfire - if one does this, Almighty Allah will include him with those whom He releases from Hellfire and he will not die before he sees in dream angels conveying to him the good tidings of entering Paradise and security against Hellfire.”\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTEENTH OF RAMADAN\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of Ramadan, AH 2, Imam al-Hasan al-Mujtaba(a.s.) was born.\r\n\r\nIn the word of Shaykh al-Mufid, Imam Muhammad al-Taqi(a.s.) was born on the fifteenth of Ramadan, AH 195. However, it is widely known that Imam Muhammad al-Taqi was not born at this date. Anyhow, the fifteenth of Ramadan is a blessed day; to give alms and to do righteous deeds on this day bring about great merits.",
