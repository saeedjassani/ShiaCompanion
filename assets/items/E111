If  you say so, you will not be affected by that disease or defect:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ عَافَانِىْ مِمَّا ابْتَلَاكَ بِهِ وَ لَوْ شَاۤءَ فَعَلَ‏--According to another tradition, the following statement should be said at such situations:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ عَافَانِىْ مِمَّا ابْتَلَاكَ بِهِ،وَ فَضَّلَنِىْ عَلَيْكَ وَ عَلٰى كَثِيْرٍ مِمَّنْ خَلَقَ۔--It is also required to say this statement as inaudibly as possible so that the defected person would not hear you.",
