    "content": "Twelfth: Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) is reported to have said, “Never be weary of reciting Surah al-Zalzalah (No. 99) frequently, because whoever recites this Surah in his supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) prayers, will be saved by Allah the Almighty and All-exalted from being hit by an earthquake and will not be caused to die because of an earthquake, a thunderbolt, or any other natural catastrophes; rather, he will die naturally. When he dies, a noble angel will come to him from the side of the Lord, sit at the side of his head, and say to the Angel of Death, ‘Be lenient while grasping the soul of this friend of Allah, for he used to refer to the Lord very much.’ Therefore, the Angel of Death will take out the soul of that servant as leniently as possible so that he will suffer from the least agonies of death. Then, his soul will be escorted by seventy thousand angels to Paradise at the least time.”\r\n\r\nAs a margin, the following has been added: “The covering will be removed from the sight of this servant so that he will see his places in Paradise.”",
