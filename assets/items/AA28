    "content": "The nineteenth night of Ramadan is the first of the Qadr Nights. Of course, the Qadr Night (laylat al-qadr) is unmatched in merits, since to practice acts of worship at this night is equal to the acts of one thousand nights. At this night, the affairs of the whole year are decided and the angels and the Greatest Spirit are descended by the permission of Almighty Allah so as to visit the Imam of the Age (i.e. Imam al-Mahdi), have the honor of being present before him, and provide the destinies of all the beings before him.\r\n\r\nThe recommended acts of the Qadr Nights are of two parts; the first part deals with the general acts that are advisably practiced at each of the three Qadr Nights. The second part deals with the private acts that are dedicated to each night exclusively.",
