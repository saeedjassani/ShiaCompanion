One of these rewards is that Almighty Allah will create one thousand angels to record the rewards of this act for thirty-six thousand years.\r\n\r\nFifth: Ibn Baabwayh and other scholars, may Allah be pleased with them, have reported through valid chains of authority that Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) quoted the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) to have said: After you perform the dawn (fajr) Prayer, you may say the following doxology (zikr) ten times, for if you do so, Almighty Allah will heal you from blindness, lunacy, leprosy, poverty, demolition, and senility:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيْمِ وَ بِحَمْدِهٖ وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔--Sixth: In the book of al-Balad al-Amin, it is reported that Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) reported the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) to have said: He who wishes that Almighty Allah will grant him a longer lifetime and victory over his enemies and safeguard him against terrible death, must keep on saying this doxology (zikr) every morning and evening. He may say the following three times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ مِلْاَ الْمِيْزَانِ وَمُنْتَهَى الْعِلْمِ وَمَبْلَغَ الرِّضَا وَزِنَةَ الْعَرْشِ وَسَعَةَ الْكُرْسِىِّ۔--He may say the following three times:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ مِلْاَ الْمِيْزَانِ وَمُنْتَهَى الْعِلْمِ وَمَبْلَغَ الرِّضَا وَزِنَةَ الْعَرْشِ وَسَعَةَ الْكُرْسِىِّ۔--He may say the following three times:\r\n\r\n--لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ مِلْاَ الْمِيْزَانِ وَمُنْتَهَى الْعِلْمِ وَمَبْلَغَ الرِّضَا وَزِنَةَ الْعَرْشِ وَسَعَةَ الْكُرْسِىِّ۔--He may say the following three times:\r\n\r\n--اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ مِلْاَ الْمِيْزَانِ وَمُنْتَهَى الْعِلْمِ وَمَبْلَغَ الرِّضَا وَزِنَةَ الْعَرْشِ وَسَعَةَ الْكُرْسِىِّ۔",
