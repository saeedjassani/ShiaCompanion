    "content": "On this blessed day, Surah al-Dahr (or al-Insan No. 76) was revealed praising the Ahl al-Bayt (a.s.) for they had observed fasting for three days and given their food to a poor, an orphan, and a captive for three days respectively. All over these three days, they used to break their fasting with water only. In view of that, the adherents (Shi’ah) of the Ahl al-Bayt (a.s.) are required to imitate their masters on these three days and give alms to the poor and the orphans, especially at the twenty-fifth night of Dhu’l-Hijjah, to do their best in offering food to the needy, and to observe fasting on these days. In the view of some scholars, the twenty-fifth of Dhu’l-Hijjah is the Day of Mubahalah; therefore, it is proper to say al-Ziyarah al-Jami’ah and Dua al-Mubahalah, which has been previously cited.",
