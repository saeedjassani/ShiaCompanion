Accordingly, it is recommended to repeat the following invocation one hundred times at that time:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ عَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ۔--Adding to this, Shaykh al-Tusi says that it is recommended to repeat the following invocation one hundred times at that time:\r\n\r\n--صَلَوَاتُ اللّٰهِ وَ مَلَاۤئِكَتِهِ وَ اَنْبِيَاۤئِهِ وَ رُسُلِهِ وَ جَمِيْعِ خَلْقِهِ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدَ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْهِ وَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَ عَلٰى اَرْوَاحِهِمْ وَ اَجْسَادِهِمْ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ۔--The reverent scholar, Ibn Idris, has quoted in his book entitled al-Sara’ir that it has been recorded in the book of Jami’ complied by al-Bizaniti on the authority of Abu-Basir that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) has said: To invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon the Prophet and his Household in the time between the Zohr and Asr Prayers (on Fridays) is equal (in reward) to seventy times of Hajj Pilgrimage. Moreover, one who says the following invocation after the Asr Prayer on Fridays will be awarded the reward of the righteous deeds of all men and jinn on that day:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ الْاَوْصِيَاۤءِ الْمَرْضِيِّيْنَ بِاَفْضَلِ صَلَوَاتِكَ وَ بَارِكْ عَلَيْهِمْ بِاَفْضَلِ بَرَكَاتِكَ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَ عَلٰى اَرْوَاحِهِمْ وَ اَجْسَادِهِمْ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ۔--Books of master scholars of Hadith have authentically narrated great rewards for saying this invocation. However, it is better to repeat it seven times and even ten times. In this respect, Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported as saying: One who repeats this invocation ten times immediately after the Asr Prayer on Fridays will receive the blessings of the angels up to the next Friday and the very hour. The Imam (a.s.) is also reported as saying: When you offer the Asr Prayer on Friday, repeat this invocation afterward seven times.\r\n\r\nIn al-Kafi, Shaykh al-Kulayni has narrated the following: When you accomplish the Asr Prayer on Friday, say the following invocation, for if one says it at that time, Almighty Allah will record for him one hundred thousand rewards, erase one hundred thousand of his evildoings, grant him one hundred thousand requests, and elevate him one hundred thousand ranks:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ الْاَوْصِيَاۤءِ الْمَرْضِيِّيْنَ بِاَفْضَلِ صَلَوَاتِكَ وَ بَارِكْ عَلَيْهِمْ بِاَفْضَلِ بَرَكَاتِكَ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْهِ وَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ ۔--He adds that if one repeats the same invocation seven times, Almighty Allah will give him rewards as many as His servants, accept his deeds on that day, and place light between his eyes on the Resurrection Day.\r\n\r\nLater on, we will mention (within the devotional rites on the ‘Arafat Day) a form of invocation of Almighty Allah’sblessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household; to say this invocation delights Prophet Muhammad and his Household - peace be upon them all.\r\n\r\nTwenty-Eighth: It is recommended to repeat the following supplicatory prayer seventy times after the Asr Prayer so that sins will be forgiven:\r\n\r\n--اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ رَبِّىْ وَ اَتُوْبُ اِلَيْهِ۔--Twenty-ninth: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Qadr (No. 97) one hundred times. Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.) is reported as saying: On Fridays, Almighty Allah has one thousand gifts of mercy. He grants a servant whatever number He wills. Thus, He grants the servant who recites Surah al-Qadr one hundred times after the Asr Prayer on Fridays all these gifts and their like.\r\n\r\nThirtieth: It is recommended to say the famous supplication known as Dua al-Ashraat, which will be mentioned in this book soon.\r\n\r\nThirty-First: Shaykh al-Tusi has mentioned that the last hour of Friday, which lasts to sunset, is the hour in which prayers are responded. Therefore, it is required to pray Almighty Allah insistently at that hour. It has been also narrated that this hour begins when half of the sun disk sets and the other half only remains visible. Lady Fatimah al-Zahra’, peace be upon her, used to pray Almighty Allah at this hour so that her prayers be answered. It is also recommended to say the following litany that is reported from the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his Household:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَكَ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ يَا حَنَّانُ يَا مَنَّانُ يَا بَدِيْعَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَ الْاَرْضِ يَا ذَا الْجَلَالِ وَ الْاِكْرَامِ۔--It is also recommended to say the famous supplicatory prayer known as Dua al-Simat - which will be mentioned in this book - at the last hour of Fridays.",
