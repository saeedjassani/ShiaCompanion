Do not assimilate yourselves to the Magians and the Jews.”\r\n\r\nHe (s) is also reported to have said, “The Magians have shaved their beards and left their mustaches unshaved. As for us, we shave the mustaches and keep the beards unshaved.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Holy Prophet (s) sent messages to the kings of his time, calling them to Islam, Khosrow the Persian king wrote a message to Bazan the governor of Yemen asking him to summon the Holy Prophet (s)! However, the Persian king sent as messengers to the Holy Prophet (s) his clerk Banawayh and another man named Kharkhask. When they presented themselves before the Holy Prophet (s), he turned his face away and hated looking at them directly because they had shaved their beards and kept their mustaches unshaved. He (s) then said to them, “Woe be to you! Who ordered you to do so?” “Our lord did,” they said, referring to Khosrow their king. The Holy Prophet (s) then said, “However, my Lord has ordered me to keep my beard and trim my mustache.”",
