    "content": "1ST NIGHT OF RABI’ AL-AWWAL\r\n\r\nAt the first night of Rabi’ al-Awwal, twelve years after the outset of his Divine Mission, the Holy Prophet migrated from Makkah to al-Madinah. At this night, he hid in Cave Thawr. Imam Ali(a.s.) sacrificed himself for the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) at this night, when he spent the night in the place of the Holy Prophet so as to give the latter enough time to leave Makkah safely and to arrive at his destination. Imam Ali(a.s.) challenged the polytheists who had plotted to assassinate the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) by attacking him in his bed collectively. Thus, everybody confessed of Imam Ali’s bravery and courage, as well as his love for and fraternity with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Immortalizing this event, Almighty Allah revealed the following holy verse: “And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Affectionate to the servants. 2/207”\r\n\r\n1ST DAY OF RABI’ AL-AWWAL\r\n\r\nScholars maintain that it is recommended to observe fasting on this day to express gratitude to Almighty Allah for His marvelous favor of having saved the Holy Prophet and Imam Ali - peace be upon them and their Household. It is also appropriate to visit their holy tombs on this day. In Iqbal al-A’mal, Sayyid Ibn Tawus has mentioned a supplicatory prayer to be said on this day.\r\n\r\nAccording to Shaykh al-Tusi and al-Kaf’ami, Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari(a.s.) departed life on this day. Yet, the most familiar report is that the Imam (a.s.) departed life on the eighth of Rabi’ al-Awwal. Probably, his ailment began on this day.\r\n\r\n8TH OF RABI’ AL-AWWAL\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of Rabi’ al-Awwal AH 260, Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari departed life; and his son, the Patron of the Age, was appointed as the twelfth Imam. It is thus appropriate to visit both of them on this day.\r\n\r\n9TH OF RABI’ AL-AWWAL\r\n\r\nThe ninth of Rabi’ al-Awwal is a feast day, which is called ‘Id al-Baqr (Feast of Stabbing). The details are so lengthy; therefore, we will omit them, and they may be investigated in other books.\r\n\r\nIt has been narrated that to give alms on this day brings about forgiveness of sins. It has been also said that it is recommended, on this day, to offer food, give pleasure to one’s brethren-in-faith, confer upon one’s family members with gifts, new clothes, and all that they need, praise and thank Almighty Allah, and practice acts of worship to Him. This day, which is also a holy day, is thus the day of removing grievances and sorrows. As the past day was the day of Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari’s martyrdom, the ninth of Rabi’ al-Awwal is thus the first day in the Imamate of Imam al-Mahdi, may Allah hasten his advent. This is an additional point of happiness on this day.",
