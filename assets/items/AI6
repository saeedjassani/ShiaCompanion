Imam al-Hasan (‘a) used to offer prayers at the fifth column, but when Imam ‘Ali (‘a) would be absent, al-Hasan (‘a) would take his place at the seventh column, which is at bab kindah (the Gate of Kindah).”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the narrations reporting the merits of the seventh column at Masjid al-Kufah are numerous; but because my course in this book is to sum up as much as possible, I will mention no more.",

    "english": "The seventh column is the place where Almighty Allah guided Prophet Adam to ask for repentance. Hence, you may walk to this place, stop there, face the kiblah direction, and say the following words:\r\n\r\nIn the Name of Allah (I begin), in Allah (I trust), and the course of Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon him and his Household, (I follow). There is no god but Allah. Muhammad is Allah’s messenger. Peace be upon our father Adam and our mother Eve. Peace be upon Abel who was killed wrongly and aggressively, because he was envied for Allah’s favors and pleasure. Peace be upon Sheeth, the select of Allah, the chosen and trustee, and upon the veracious, select ones from his immaculate progeny, from the first to the last. Peace be upon Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob, and upon their chosen descendants. Peace be upon Moses the spoken by Allah. Peace be upon Jesus the spirit of Allah. Peace be upon Muhammad the son of 'Abdullah, the seal of the Prophets. Peace be upon the Commander of the Faithful and upon his immaculate progeny. Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon them. Peace be upon you among the ancient generations. Peace be upon you among the coming generations. Peace be upon Fatimah al-Zahra’ (the Luminous Lady). Peace be upon the guiding Imams: the witnesses of Allah upon His created beings. Peace be upon the supervisor: the witness on the nations for Allah the Lord of the worlds.\r\n\r\nAt the same place, you may offer a four unit prayer reciting in the first unit Surah alFatihah and Surah alQadr and reciting in the second unit Surah alFatihah and Surah alTawhid and repeat the same in the third and fourth units. When you finish this prayer and say the Tasbih statements, you may then say the following supplicatory words:\r\n\r\nO Allah, if I have disobeyed you, I have also obeyed you in my belief in You. This is out of Your favoring upon me, not a favor that I do to You. I have also obeyed You in the things that You most like: I have not claimed that You have child and I have not associated any one with You. Yet, I have disobeyed You in many things, on account of neither defiance, nor mutiny against my servitude to You, nor denial of Your Godhead; rather, I only followed my lusts, and Satan caused me to slip although You have had clear argument against me. Thus, if You chastise me, then it is on account of my sins and You are never unjust to me. And if You pardon me and have mercy upon me, then this is out of Your magnanimity and generosity, O All-generous. O Allah, nothing can stand for my sins except my hope in Your pardon, although I have done. things due to which I deserve deprivation of Your pardon. Therefore, I beseech You, O Allah, for that which I do not deserve and I seek from You that which I do not merit. O Allah, if you chastise me, then this will be on account of my sins and You shall never be unjust to me. But if You forgive me, then You are already the best of all those who show mercy, O my Master. O Allah, You are what You are and I am what I am: You are always returning with forgiveness and I always return with sinning. You always confer with forbearance and I always return with impatience. O Allah, I do beseech You, O treasure of the weak, O He in Whom great hope is put, O rescuer of the drowned, O savior of those about to perish, O He Who causes the alive to die, O He Who causes the dead to live again! You are Allah; there is no god but You. It is You before Whom has prostrated the ray of the sun, the sound of water, the rustling of trees, and the moonlight, the murk of night, the light of daytime, and the flapping of birds. I thus beseech You, O All-great, in the name of the duty of Muhammad and his veracious Household towards You, in the name of Your duty towards Muhammad and his veracious Household, in the name of the duty of ‘Ali towards You, in the name of Your duty towards ‘Ali, in the name of the duty of Fatimah towards You, in the name of Your duty towards Fatimah, in the name of the duty of al-Hasan towards You, in the name of Your duty towards al-Hasan, in the name of the duty of al-Husayn towards You, and in the name of Your duty towards al-Husayn. Verily, Your duty towards them is one of the greatest blessings that You conferred upon them. And (I beseech You) in the name of the position that You enjoy with them and in the name of the position that they enjoy with You to (please) bless them, O Lord, with blessings that are as endless until they attain Your pleasure, to forgive me, in their names, the sins that I committed concerning my duties towards You, to make Your creatures to be satisfied with me, to complete Your favors upon me in the same way as You had completed them upon my forefathers, not to cause any of Your creatures to have any role in these favors, to confer upon me with graces in the same way as You had already done with my forefathers, O kaf-ha’-ya’-'ayn-sad. O Allah, in the same way as You have poured blessings upon Muhammad and his Household, (please) respond to my entreaty as regards that which I have asked from You, O All-generous! O All-generous! O All-generous!\r\n\r\nYou may then prostrate yourself and say (while prostrating) the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO He Who has full power over settling the requests of the beseechers and Who knows what is hidden in the inner selves of the silent ones. O He Who does not require explanation. O He Who knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal. O He Who decided chastisement to befall the people of (Prophet) Jonah and as He decided to chastise them, they prayed Him and besought Him; so, He removed from them the chastisement and He gave them provision until a time. You do see where I am, You do hear my prayer, You do know what I conceal, what I declare, and in what situation I am: (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, and relieve me from all that which has aggrieved me from the affairs of my religion, my worldly life, and my Next Life.\r\n\r\nYou may then repeat the following statement seventy times:\r\n\r\nO my Master.\r\n\r\nYou may then raise your head from the state of prostration and say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO my Lord, I pray You to grant me the blessing of this place and the blessing of its people. And I pray You to grant me sustenance from Your sustenance; sustenance that is legal and pleasant, and that You bring it to me by Your might and power, while I experience good health, O most merciful of all those who show mercy.\r\n\r\nIn the book of alMazar alQadim, it is mentioned that the following supplication may be said immediately after the abovementioned supplication that ends with ya karimu ya karimu ya karimu:\r\n\r\nO He through whom the knots of detested things are untied! O He through whom the cutting edge of hardships is blunted!...\r\n\r\nThis supplication, which has been mentioned in the first section of this book under the title of du’a’ alamn (Supplication for Security), is one of the supplications of alSahifah alSajjadiyyah.\r\n\r\nThe writer of alMazar alQadim has added that the following supplication may be said:\r\n\r\nO Allah, You verily know while I do not, You have power (over all things) while I do not, and You are the Knower of all unseen things. (Please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, forgive me, have mercy upon me, overlook my sins, and confer upon me with that which is befitting You, O most merciful of all those who show mercy.\r\n\r\nBe it known to you that the narrations carrying the merits of the seventh column in Masjid alKufah are numerous.
