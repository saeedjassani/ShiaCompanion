In this respect, a Hadith reads that an angel is commissioned to respond to everyone who says,\r\n\r\n--صَلَّى اللهُ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِهِ وَ سَلَّمَ۔--by saying, “peace be upon you, too.” That angle, then, tells the Holy Prophet (s) that so-and-so has greeted him; therefore, the Holy Prophet (s) says, “May peace be upon him, too.”\r\n\r\nAccording to a considerable narration, the Holy Prophet (s) has said, “He who visits my tomb after my death will be considered to have immigrated to me in my lifetime. If you cannot visit my tomb, you can send me greetings, for they reach me.”\r\n\r\nToo many are the other narrations that carry the same meaning.\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter of the Ziyarahs of the Holy Infallibles (‘a) on the days of the week, I have mentioned two forms of ziyarah of the Holy Prophet. Yu may refer to them to win the rewards of reciting them.( )\r\n\r\nIt is also advisable to repeat the following words that Imam ‘Ali (‘a) mentioned in one of his sermons on Friday, as is cited in the book of al-Rawzah min al-Kafi, representing an invocation of Allah’s blessings upon the Holy Prophet (s):\r\n\r\n--اِنَّ اللّٰهَ وَ مَلَاۤئِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّوْنَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ يَاۤ اَيُّهَا الَّذِيْنَ اٰمَنُوْا صَلُّوْا عَلَيْهِ وَ سَلِّمُوْا تَسْلِيْمًا اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ بَارِكْ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ تَحَنَّنْ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ سَلِّمْ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَاَفْضَلِ مَا صَلَّيْتَ وَ بَارَكْتَ وَ تَرَحَّمْتَ وَ تَحَنَّنْتَ وَ سَلَّمْتَ عَلٰۤى اِبْرَاهِيْمَ وَ اٰلِ اِبْرَاهِيْمَ اِنَّكَ حَمِيْدٌ مَجِيْدٌ اَللّٰهُمَّ اَعْطِ مُحَمَّدًا ۟اِلْوَسِيْلَةَ وَ الشَّرَفَ وَ الْفَضِيْلَةَ وَ الْمَنْزِلَةَ الْكَرِيْمَةَ اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْ مُحَمَّدًا وَ اٰلَ مُحَمَّدٍ اَعْظَمَ الْخَلَاۤئِقِ كُلِّهِمْ شَرَفًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَ اَقْرَبَهُمْ مِنْكَ مَقْعَدًا وَ اَوْجَهَهُمْ عِنْدَكَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ جَاهًا وَ اَفْضَلَهُمْ عِنْدَكَ مَنْزِلَةً وَ نَصِيْبًا اَللّٰهُمَّ اَعْطِ مُحَمَّدًا اَشْرَفَ الْمَقَامِ وَ حِبَاۤءَ السَّلَامِ وَ شَفَاعَةَ الْاِسْلَامِ اَللّٰهُمَّ وَ اَلْحِقْنَا بِهِ غَيْرَ خَزَايَا وَ لَا نَاكِثِيْنَ وَ لَا نَادِمِيْنَ وَ لَا مُبَدِّلِيْنَ اِلٰهَ الْحَقِّ اٰمِيْنَ۔--At the end of the current section of the book, another form of invoking Allah’s blessing upon the Holy Prophet and his Household will be cited.",

You are verily Owner of praise, Owner of glory. O Allah, give Muhammad [the right of] mediation, honor, virtue, and noble rank. O Allah, make Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad to be the most honored of all Your creatures on the Resurrection Day, the closest to You in position, the most notable with You on the Resurrection Day, and the most favorable in title and status. O Allah, give Muhammad the most honorable position, the most abundant salutation, and the intercession of Islam. O Allah, join us to him while we are neither disgraced, nor violating, nor regretful, nor distorting. O God of all worlds, respond to us.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the current section of the book, another form of invoking Allah’s blessing upon the Holy Prophet and his Household will be cited."
