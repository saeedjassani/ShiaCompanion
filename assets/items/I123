    "content": "In his book entitled Misbah al-Mutahajjid, Shaykh al-Tusi says:\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to carry a coffin from the four sides, beginning with the right side of the hand, the right side of the leg, the left side of the leg, and ending with the left side of the hand. Thus should the four sides of a coffin be carried. Hence, the bearer should turn around a coffin just like the turning of a hand mill.",
