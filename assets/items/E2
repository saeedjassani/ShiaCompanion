Such statements can be found in the Holy Qur’an in five verses of five different Surahs:  al-Baqarah (2:255), Al-’Imran (3:2), al-Nisa’ (4:87), Taahaa (20:8), and al-Taghabun (64:13). Shaykh al-Maghribi says, “If one betakes to these five verses as a supplicatory prayer that is repeated eleven times a day, all his general and particular affairs will be made easy for him without delay, Allah willing.” These five verses are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: Verse 155 of Surah al-Baqarah (No. 2), which has been previously cited in this book.\r\n\r\n--وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَىْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوْعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الْاَمْوَالِ وَالْاَنْفُسِ وَالثَّمَرٰتِؕ وَبَشِّرِ الصّٰبِرِيْنَۙ‏(155)--Second: Verse 2 of Surah Al-’Imran (No. 3):\r\n\r\n--اَللهُ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّوْمُ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَ اَنْزَلَ التَّوْرَاةَ وَ الْاِنْجِيْلَ مِنْ قَبْلُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَ اَنْزَلَ الْفُرْقَانَ--Third: Verse 87 of Surah al-Nisa’ (No. 4):\r\n\r\n--اَللهُ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا هُوَ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ اِلٰى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيْهِ وَ مَنْ اَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللّٰهِ حَدِيْثًا--Fourth: Verse 8 of Surah Taahaa (No. 20):\r\n\r\n--اَللهُ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا هُوَ لَهُ الْاَسْمَاۤءُ الْحُسْنٰى--Fifth: Verse 13 of Surah al-Taghabun (No. 64):\r\n\r\n--اَللهُ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا هُوَ وَ عَلَى اللّٰهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُوْنَ",

Such statements can be found in the Holy Qur’an in five verses of five different Surahs:6 al-Baqarah (2:255), Al-’Imran (3:2), al-Nisa’ (4:87), Taahaa (20:8), and al-Taghabun (64:13).
