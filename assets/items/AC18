It is in fact the most celebrated feast day. All the Prophets that Almighty Allah appointed used to celebrate this day and maintain its sanctity. In the heavens, this day is called “the Day of the Promised Covenant” and in the earth “the Day of the Exacted Covenant and the Witnessed Crowd.”\r\n\r\nIt has been narrated that when Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) was asked whether Muslims have a feast day other than ‘Id al-Fitr, ‘Id al-Adha, and Fridays, he answered, “Yes, they have. There is still the holiest feast day, which falls on the day when the Messenger of Allah (a.s.) appointed Ameer al-Momineen -Imam Ali- (a.s.) (as his successor and the coming leader of the Muslim community). On that day, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) declared, ‘Whoever has regarded me as his master must now regard Ali as his master.’ It falls on the eighteenth of ZILHAJJ.”\r\n\r\nWhen he was asked about the deeds that should be done on that day, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) instructed, “(The best acts on this day are) observance of fasting, acts of worship, mention of the Household of the Holy Prophet, and invocation of blessings upon them. The Holy Messenger of Allah (a.s.) instructed Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) to betake that day as feast. Similarly, the Prophets (a.s.) used to instruct their successors to betake the eighteenth of ZILHAJJ as feast day.”\r\n\r\nAbu-Nasr al-Bizanti has narrated that Imam al-Rida(a.s.) said to him, “Wherever you are, try to be present on the Ghadir Day at the tomb of Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.). Verily, Almighty Allah will forgive the sins of sixty years for any believer and Muslim - male and female - on that day and will release from Hellfire twice as many as the number of those whom He releases from Hellfire in the month of Ramadan, at the Qadr Night and at the ‘Id al-Fitr Night. A single dirham (a currency) that is given as alms on this day to the believing brethren is equal to one thousand dirhams (that are given as alms on other occasions). Try to do favors to your brethren on this day and try to please each believing man and woman. By Allah I swear, if people recognized the reality of this day, the angels should shake hands with them ten times a day.”\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, to honor this day is necessary. The devotional acts on the ‘Id al-Ghadir Day are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: It is recommended to observe fasting on this day, for it erases the sins of sixty years. Furthermore, it has been narrated that to observe fasting on this day is equal to the observance of fasting of one’s whole lifetime and its reward is equal to the rewards of one hundred times of Hajj and ‘Umrah.\r\n\r\nSecond: It is recommended to bathe oneself on this day.\r\n\r\nThird: It is recommended to visit the holy tomb of Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.). It is necessary to do one’s best to attend at the holy tomb of Imam Ali(a.s.) on this day even if such a journey be difficult. Three forms of Ziyarat have been decided for this day. The first is the familiar Ziyarat Aminullah, which can be practiced whether one is present at the holy tomb or is far away from it. This form of Ziyarah, which will be cited in this book, is also one of the general, comprehensive forms of Ziyarat.\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to say the supplication of seeking Almighty Allah’s protection against Satan (i.e. Isti’adhah), which is mentioned by Sayyid Ibn Tawus, in his book of Iqbal al-A’mal, who has reported it from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.).",
