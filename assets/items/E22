The question whether this supplication has been reported from the Holy Imams, peace be upon them, or has been composed by a certain scholar is controversial. Concerning this, our master Hajj MirzaHusayn al-Nuri, a master Hadithist and well-versed in the reports of the Holy Imams, peace be upon them, says that Dua al-’Adilah has been composed by some scholars since it cannot be found in the famous books of Hadith. It is also worth mentioning that Shaykh al-Tusi has narrated that Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Daylami said to Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) “Your adherents say that Faith is of two sections; one is steady and the other depository. So, please teach me a supplication that makes my faith perfect and saves it from removal.” Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) hence taught him to say the following supplicatory prayer after each obligatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--رَضِيْتُ بِاللّٰهِ رَبًّا وَ بِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ اٰلِهِ نَبِيًّا وَ بِالْاِسْلَامِ دِيْنًا وَ بِالْقُرْاٰنِ كِتَابًا وَ بِالْكَعْبَةِ قِبْلَةً وَ بِعَلِيٍّ وَلِيًّا وَ اِمَامًا وَ بِالْحَسَنِ وَ الْحُسَيْنِ وَ عَلِيِّ بْنِ الْحُسَيْنِ وَ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ وَ جَعْفَرِ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ مُوْسَى بْنِ جَعْفَرٍ وَ عَلِيِّ بْنِ مُوْسٰى وَ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ وَ عَلِيِّ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ الْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ وَ الْحُجَّةِ بْنِ الْحَسَنِ صَلَوَاتُ اللّٰهِ عَلَيْهِمْ اَئِمَّةً اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْ رَضِيْتُ بِهِمْ اَئِمَّةً فَارْضَنِيْ لَهُمْ اِنَّكَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَيْ‏ءٍ قَدِيْرٌ۔",
