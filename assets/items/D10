I consequently wander in countries searching for it. By doing such, I am as confused as the confounded, since I do not know whether my sustenance lies in a plain, on a mountain, on the ground, in the air, on lands, in seas, at whose hands, or who the source of it is. I have full knowledge that You know all these, the causes of them are in Your Hands, and it is You Who distribute it out of Your compassion and cause it out of Your mercy. O Allah, please send blessings to Muhammad and his Household and make, O Lord, Your sustenance that is provided (by You) to me expansive, my seeking for it easy for me, and its source close to me. Please, do not fatigue me by seeking that which You have not decided for me to take, because You are certainly in no need for tormenting me while I am in full need for Your mercy. (Please) Send blessings upon Muhammad and his Household and confer liberally upon me, Your slave, out of Your graciousness. You are surely the Lord of great favor. \r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the abovementioned supplication is one of the supplications restricted to seeking sustenance.\r\n\r\nTHE WUTAYRAH PRAYER\r\n\r\nUpon accomplishment of the Evening Prayer, it is recommended to recite Surah al-Qadr (No. 97) seven times and offer the Wutayrah supererogatory prayer, which consists of two units and should be offered in the position of sitting by reciting one hundred verses of the Holy Qur’an in both the units.
