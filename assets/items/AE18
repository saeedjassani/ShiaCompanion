    "content": "Al-Muhaqqiq al-Damad added: It has been reported that ‘Abd al-’Azim al-Hasani, disguising himself, used to leave the place of his residence for visiting the tomb that would be opposite to his tomb at the other side of the road. He used to say that the tomb was for one of the descendants of Imam Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kazim, peace be upon him.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, we can see at this place a tomb ascribed to Hamzah the son of Imam Musa al-Kazim. Apparently, ‘Abd al-’Azim al-Hasani used to visit this tomb; it is therefore imperative to visit this tomb, too.\r\n\r\nAt visiting this tomb, it is unobjectionable to say the same form of ziyarah that is said at visiting the tomb of ‘Abd al-’Azim with some changes, of course, in the statements in which the name of ‘Abd al-’Azim is mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the courtyard of the shrine of Hamzah the son of Imam al-Kazim, there lies the tomb of the pleased and sublime master scholar and the exemplar of exegetes of the Holy Qur’an, Jamal al-Din Abu’l-Futuh Husayn ibn ‘Ali al-Khuza’i, the author of the famous book of Tafsir. It is therefore important to visit his tomb.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Shaykh al-Saduq, the head of traditionists, known as Ibn Babawayh, lies in a place near the town in which ‘Abd al-’Azim al-Hasani was buried. It is also important not to neglect visiting his tomb.",
