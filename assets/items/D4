    "content": "Upon accomplishment of the Night Prayer, you may stand up for offering the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) dawn (fajr) prayer, which consists of two units in the first of which you may recite Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Kafirun and in the second unit Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Tawheed. When you accomplish the prayer, you may sleep on the right side like a dead in the grave, put your right cheek on your right hand, and say the following:\r\n\r\n--اِسْتَمْسَكْتُ بِعُرْوَةِ اللهِ الْوُثْقَى الَّتِىْ لَاانْفِصَامَ لَهَا وَاعْتَصَمْتُ بِحَبْلِ اللهِ الْمَتِيْنِ وَ اَعُوْذُ بِاللهِ مِنْ شَرِّ فَسَقَةِ الْعَرَبِ وَالْعَجَمِ وَ اَعُوْذُ بِاللهِ مِنْ شَرِّ فَسَقَةِ الْجِنِّ وَالْاِنْسِ۔--You may then repeat the following doxology (zikr) three times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ رَبِّ الصَّبَاحِ فَالِقِ الْاِصْبَاحِ۔--You may then recite the previously mentioned five verses of SurahAl-’Imran.\r\n\r\nYou may then sit and say Tasbih al-Zahra’.\r\n\r\nIn the book of Man-La-Yahduruhul-Faqih, it is reported that whoever invoke blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household one hundred times between the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) and the obligatory dawn (fajr) prayers, Almighty Allah will save his face from the heat of Hellfire.\r\n\r\nWhoever repeats the following supplicatory prayer one hundred times, Almighty Allah will build for him a house in Paradise:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ رَبِّىَ الْعَظِيْمِ وَ بِحَمْدِہٖ اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ رَبِّىْ وَ اَتُوْبُ اِلَيْهِ۔‏--Whoever recites Surah al-Tawheed twenty-one times, Almighty Allah will build for him a house in Paradise, and whoever recites it forty times, Almighty Allah will forgive him.\r\n\r\nAfter accomplishing the Night Prayer, it is highly advisable to say the thirty-second supplication of al-Sahifah al-Kamilah al-Sajjadiyyah:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ يَا ذَا الْمُلْكِ الْمُتَاَبِّدِ۔۔۔--You may then do a thanksgiving prostration during which you are highly advised to pray for the good of your brothers-in-faith and say the aforementioned supplication that is said in the thanksgiving prostrations and begins with the following statement:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ رَبِّ الْفَجْرِ۔۔۔--I please my faithful brothers to mention me - the sinful whose face has been blackened by sins - in their supplications, because I am in urgent need for prayers. Eventually, Allah is the source of success.",
