What is my status with You? If it is praiseworthy, then I will try to add up to my good deeds; but if it is blameworthy, I will repent to You before I die.”\r\n\r\nReplying to his question, Almighty Allah sent to him one of His angels to tell him that he has no good point with Allah.\r\n\r\n“O Lord!” asked the man, “Where are then all my deeds?”\r\n\r\nThe Lord answered, “Whenever you did a good deed, you told people about it so that they would consider you virtuous and mention you reputably. Therefore, no reward will be given for your deeds except the reward that you have accepted for yourself.”\r\n\r\nThis fact disturbed and aggrieved the man extremely; therefore, Almighty Allah sent the same angel to convey the following message to him: “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says to you that you must purchase yourself from Him with alms that you must give every day for each one of your veins.”\r\n\r\nThe man asked, “O Lord! Is there any creature able to do that?”\r\n\r\nThe Almighty instructed, “You may repeat the following statement three hundred and sixty times, the number of your veins, every day:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَالْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ وَلَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَاللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَاقُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ۔--The man said, “O Lord! Please, give me more.”\r\n\r\nThe Almighty said, “If you add to the number, I will add to you.”\r\n\r\nAl-Kulayni has reported through a valid chain of authority that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) said: The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to repeat the following doxology (zikr) three hundred and sixty times, the number of the veins, each day:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ كَثِيْرًا عَلٰى كُلِّ حَالٍ۔",
