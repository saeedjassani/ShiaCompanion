Therefore, my father took me to the hospital where all physicians, headed by the Christian doctor of medicine, tried to find me treatment, but failed. Finally, they had to confess, “This disease cannot be healed except by God the All-exalted.” With breaking heart and distress, I had to go back home. Browsing one of my father’s books, I found the following inscribed on the back of the book:\r\n\r\nImam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said: Any diseased person who repeats these statements forty times immediately after the dawn (fajr) Prayer and then rubs the painful part with his hand, Almighty Allah will free him from the disease and restore him to health:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ اَلْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ حَسْبُنَا اللّٰهُ وَ نِعْمَ الْوَكِيْلُ تَبَارَكَ اللّٰهُ اَحْسَنُ الْخَالِقِيْنَ وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَاقُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔--I, the patient, waited for dawn (fajr), performed the obligatory prayer, and sat in my place repeating these words while I was fearful lest the pains would return to me. Keeping on this state for three days, the disease was gone. My father, after I had told him about this, thanked Almighty Allah. When he informed one of the physicians about the restoration of my health, the physician, who was non-Muslim, visited and examined me. When he was sure that my disease had gone, he converted to Islam, bore witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God, and committed himself to the teachings of Islam.",
