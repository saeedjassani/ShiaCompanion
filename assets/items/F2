    "content": "The following is an easy-to-do method of offering the Night Prayer that everyone can do:\r\n\r\nWhen you wake up at night, it is recommended to prostrate yourself before Almighty Allah. It is recommended that you say the following doxology (zikr) during or after the prostration:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ اَحْيَانِىْ بَعْدَ مَا اَمَاتَنِىْ وَ اِلَيْهِ النُّشُوْرُ اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ رَدَّ عَلَىَّ رُوْحِىْ لِاَحْمَدَهٗ وَاَعْبُدَهٗ۔--When you get up and stand up, say the following supplication:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اَعِنِّىْ عَلٰى هَوْلِ الْمُطَّلَعِ وَ وَسِّعْ عَلَىَّ الْمَضْجَعَ وَارْزُقْنِىْ خَيْرَمَا بَعْدَ الْمَوْتِ۔--When you hear the sounds of roosters, say the following:\r\n\r\n--سُبُّوْحٌ قُدُّوْسٌ رَبُّ الْمَلَاۤئِكَةِ وَالرُّوْحِ سَبَقَتْ رَحْمَتُكَ غَضَبَكَ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ عَمِلْتُ سُوْءًا وَظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِىْ فَاغْفِرْلِىْ اِنَّهٗ لَايَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوْبَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ فَتُبْ عَلَىَّ اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيْمُ۔--When you raise your sight towards the sky, say the following supplication:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّهُ لَايُوَارِىْ مِنْكَ لَيْلٌ سَاجٍ وَلَاسَمَاۤءٌ ذَاتُ اَبْرَاجٍ وَلَا اَرْضٌ ذَاتُ مِهَادٍ وَلَاظُلُمَاتٌ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَ لَابَحْرٌ لُجِّىٌّ تُدْلِجُ بَيْنَ يَدَىِ الْمُدْلِجِ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ تُدْلِجُ الرَّحْمَةَ عَلٰى مَنْ تَشَاۤءُ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ تَعْلَمُ خَاۤئِنَةَ الْاَعْيُنِ وَ مَا تُخْفِىْ الصُّدُوْرُ غَارَتِ النُّجُوْمُ وَنامَتِ الْعُيُوْنُ وَ اَنْتَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّوْمُ لَا تَاْخُذُكَ سِنَةٌ وَّلَانَوْمٌ سُبْحَانَ اللهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ وَ اِلٰهِ الْمُرْسَلِيْنَ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ۔--After that, you may recite the following five Quranic verses from SurahAl-’Imran (No. 3):\r\n\r\n--اِنَّ فِىْ خَلْقِ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْاَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ لَاٰيَاتٍ لِاُوْلىِ الْاَلْبَابِ الَّذِيْنَ يَذْكُرُوْنَ اللهَ قِيَامًا وَ قُعُوْدًا وَ عَلٰى جُنُوْبِهِمْ وَ يَتَفَكَّرُوْنَ فِىْ خَلْقِ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْاَرْضِ رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ رَبَّنَا اِنَّكَ مَنْ تُدْخِلِ النَّارَ فَقَدْ اَخْزَيْتَهٗ وَ مَا لِلظَّالِمِيْنَ مِنْ اَنْصَارٍ رَبَّنَا اِنَّنَا سَمِعْنَا مُنَادِيًا يُنَادِىْ لِلْاِيْمَانِ اَنْ اٰمِنُوْا بِرَبِّكُمْ فَاٰمَنَّا رَبَّنَا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوْبَنَا وَ كَفِّرْ عَنَّا سَيِّئَاۤتِنَا وَ تَوَفَّنَا مَعَ الْاَبْرَارِ رَبَّنَا وَ اٰتِنَا مَا وَعَدْتَنَا عَلٰى رُسُلِكَ وَ لَا تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ اِنَّكَ لَا تُخْلِفُ الْمِيْعَادَ۔--When you intend to take initiative to the night worship but you need to go to toilet, you may start with it. When you go out of toilet, cleanse your teeth with the traditional stick of Miswak. Afterward, you may perform the ritual ablution as completely as possible and then perfume and ready yourself for the Night Prayer.\r\n\r\nTHE TIME OF NAMAZ E SHAB\r\n\r\nThe time of the Night Prayer begins after midnight; yet, it is recommended to perform it as near as possible to dawn (fajr). However, when dawn (fajr) comes while one has still four units of the prayer to perform, one may recite only Surah al-Faatehah in the rest of the prayer.\r\n\r\nThe Night Prayer consists of eight units of prayer; each two alone. Taslim should be said at the end of each two units with the intention of offering the Night Prayer. It is advisable to repeat Surah al-Tawheed thirty times in each unit of the first couple after reciting Surah al-Faatehah.\r\n\r\nBy doing such, one’s all sins will be forgiven as soon as he finishes the prayer. It is also recommended to recite (after Surah al-Faatehah) Surah al-Tawheed in the first unit and Surah al-Kafirun in the second.\r\n\r\nIn the other units of the prayer, one may recite any Surah he chooses. However, it is sufficiently acceptable to recite Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Tawheed in each unit of the Night Prayer. It is also permissible to recite Surah al-Faatehah alone.\r\n\r\nQUNUT\r\n\r\nLike obligatory prayers, it is highly recommended to practice Qunut in the second unit of each couple of the units of supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) prayers. At least, it is sufficient to repeat the following statement three times in Qunut:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللهِ۔--It is also sufficient to say this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لَنَا وَ ارْحَمْنَا وَ عَافِنَا وَ اعْفُ عَنَّا فِى الدُّنْيَا وَ الْاٰخِرَةِ اِنَّكَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيْرٌ۔--or this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--رَبِّ اغْفِرْ وَ ارْحَمْ وَ تَجَاوَزْ عَمَّا تَعْلَمُ اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ الْاَعَزُّ الْاَجَلُّ الْاَكْرَمُ۔--It is narrated that Imam Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kazim (a.s.) used to say the following supplicatory prayer in his night worship:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّكَ خَلَقْتَنِىْ سَوِيًّا۔۔۔--THE SHAF’ AND THE WATR PRAYER\r\n\r\nWhen you accomplish the eight-unit Night Prayer, you may then offer the two-unit Shaf’ Prayer and the one-unit Watr Prayer. In these three units, you are advised to recite, after Surah al-Faatehah, Surah al-Tawheed once so that you may be considered as having recited the entire Qur’an. Narrations have confirmed that Surah al-Tawheed is equivalent to one-third of the Holy Qur’an.\r\n\r\nYou may also recite in the first unit of the Shaf’ Prayer Surah al-Nas (No. 114) and in the second Surah al-Falaq (No. 113).\r\n\r\nWhen you accomplish the Shaf’ Prayer, you may say this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اِلٰهِيْ تَعَرَّضَ لَكَ فِي هٰذَا اللَّيْلِ الْمُتَعَرِّضُوْنَ وَ قَصَدَكَ الْقَاصِدُوْنَ وَ اَمَّلَ فَضْلَكَ وَ مَعْرُوْفَكَ الطَّالِبُوْنَ وَ لَكَ فِيْ هٰذَا اللَّيْلِ نَفَحَاتٌ وَ جَوَاۤئِزُ وَ عَطَايَا وَ مَوَاهِبُ تَمُنُّ بِهَا عَلٰى مَنْ تَشَاۤءُ مِنْ عِبَادِكَ وَ تَمْنَعُهَا مَنْ لَمْ تَسْبِقْ لَهُ الْعِنَايَةُ مِنْكَ وَ هَاۤ اَنَا ذَا عُبَيْدُكَ الْفَقِيْرُ اِلَيْكَ الْمُؤَمِّلُ فَضْلَكَ وَ مَعْرُوْفَكَ فَاِنْ كُنْتَ يَا مَوْلَايَ تَفَضَّلْتَ فِيْ هٰذِهِ اللَّيْلَةِ عَلٰىۤ اَحَدٍ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ وَ عُدْتَ عَلَيْهِ بِعَاۤئِدَةٍ مِنْ عَطْفِكَ فَصَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ ۟اِلطَّيِّبِيْنَ الطَّاهِرِيْنَ الْخَيِّرِيْنَ الْفَاضِلِيْنَ وَ جُدْ عَلَيَّ بِطَوْلِكَ وَ مَعْرُوْفِكَ يَا رَبَّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ وَ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ خَاتَمِ النَّبِيِّيْنَ وَ اٰلِهِ الطَّاهِرِيْنَ وَ سَلَّمَ تَسْلِيْمًا اِنَّ اللّٰهَ حَمِيْدٌ مَجِيْدٌ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْۤ اَدْعُوْكَ كَمَاۤ اَمَرْتَ فَاسْتَجِبْ لِيْ كَمَا وَعَدْتَ اِنَّكَ لَا تُخْلِفُ الْمِيْعَادَ۔--This supplicatory prayer has been mentioned in the book of Mafatih al-Jinan within the recommended acts on the fifteenth night of Sha’ban.\r\n\r\nUpon accomplishment of the Shaf’ Prayer, you may stand up for offering the Watr Prayer. After Surah al-Faatehah, you may recite Surah al-Tawheed once or three times alone or with Surah al-Falaq and Surah al-Nas.\r\n\r\nYou may then raise your hands for Qunut and implore Almighty Allah for anything you desire.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Shaykh al-Tusi, the supplications for Qunut are too numerous to be counted. Generally, there are not definite supplications to be said in Qunut, for it is permissible to say anything.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended, during Qunut, to weep, or even try to weep, out of fear of Almighty Allah and fear of His chastisement. It is also desirable to pray Almighty Allah for the good of one’s brethren-in-faith, for narrations have confirmed that one who prays for the good of forty of his friends shall have all his prayers responded.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Saduq, in his book of Man-La-Yahduruhul-Faqih, has recorded that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to say the following supplicatory prayer in the Watr Prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اهْدِنِىْ فِيْمَنْ هَدَيْتَ وَ عَافِنِىْ فِيْمَنْ عَافَيْتَ وَ تَوَلَّنِىْ فِيْمَنْ تَوَلَّيْتَ وَ بَارِكْ لِىْ فِيْمَا اَعْطَيْتَ وَقِنِىْ شَرَّ مَا قَضَيْتَ فَاِنَّكَ تَقْضِىْ وَ لَا يُقْضٰى عَلَيْكَ سُبْحَانَكَ رَبَّ الْبَيْتِ اَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَ اَتُوْبُ اِلَيْكَ وَ اُوْمِنُ بِكَ وَ اَتَوَكَّلُ عَلَيْكَ وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِكَ يَا رَحِيْمُ۔--It is also highly advisable to repeat the following imploration seventy times and, meanwhile, raise the left hand for supplicating and count with the right hand:\r\n\r\n--اَسْتَغْفِرُاللهَ رَبِّىْ وَ اَتُوْبُ اِلَيْهِ۔--It is also narrated that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to implore for Almighty Allah’s forgiveness seventy times during the Watr Prayer and then say the following statement:\r\n\r\n--هٰذَا مَقامُ الْعَاۤئِذِ بِكَ مِنَ النَّارِ۔--It is also narrated that Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-’Abidin (a.s.) used to repeat the following word three hundred times during the Watr Prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَلْعَفْوَ اَلْعَفْوَ۔--After that, the Imam (a.s.) would say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِىْ وَ ارْحَمْنِىْ وَ تُبْ عَلىَّ اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ التَّوَّابُ الْغَفُوْرُ الرَّحِيْمُ۔--It is highly advisable to extend your Qunut as long as possible. Thereafter, you go to the ritual genuflection (ruku') of the prayer and when you raise your head, you should say the following supplicatory prayer that Shaykh al-Tusi, in his book of Tahzeeb al-Ahkam, reports from Imam Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kazim (a.s.):\r\n\r\n--هٰذَا مَقَامُ مَنْ حَسَنَاتُهٗ نِعْمَةٌ مِنْكَ وَ شُكْرُهٗ ضَعِيْفٌ وَ ذَنْبُهٗ عَظِيْمٌ وَ لَيْسَ لِذٰلِكَ اِلَّا رِفْقُكَ وَ رَحْمَتُكَ فَاِنَّكَ قُلْتَ فِىْ كِتَابِكَ الْمُنْزَلِ عَلٰى نَبِيِّكَ الْمُرْسَلِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ اٰلِهٖ كَانُوْا قَلِيْلًا مِنَ اللَّيْلِ مَا يَهْجَعُوْنَ وَ بِالْاَسْحَارِ هُمْ يَسْتَغْفِرُوْنَ طَالَ هُجُوْعِىْ وَ قَلَّ قِيَامِىْ وَ هٰذَا السَّحَرُ وَ اَنَا اَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِذُنُوْبِىْ اِسْتِغْفَارَ مَنْ لَا يَجِدُ لِنَفْسِهِ ضَرًّا وَ لَا نَفْعًا وَ لا مَوْتًا وَ لَا حَيَاةً وَ لَا نُشُوْرًا۔--You may then prostrate yourself and accomplish the prayer. After the accomplishment, you may say Tasbih al-Zahra’. After that, you may say the following doxology (zikr):\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِرَبِّ الصَّبَاحِ الْحَمْدُ لِفَالِقِ الْاِصْبَاحِ۔--You may then repeat the following doxology (zikr) three times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ رَبِّىَ الْمَلِكِ الْقُدُّوْسِ الْعَزِيْزِ الْحَكِيْمِ۔--You may then say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--يَا حَىُّ يَا قَيُّوْمُ، يَا بَرُّ يَا رَحِيْمُ يَا غَنِىُّ يَا كَرِيْمُ اُرْزُقْنِىْ مِنَ التِّجَارَةِ اَعْظَمَهَا فَضْلًا وَ اَوْسَعَهَا رِزْقًا وَ خَيْرَهَا لِىْ عَاقِبَةً فَاِنَّهٗ لَا خَيْرَ فِيْمَا لَا عَاقِبَةَ لَهٗ۔--It is also highly advisable to say the following supplicatory prayer, which is called Dua al-Hazin (The Supplication of the Sad):\r\n\r\n--اُنَاجِیْكَ یَا مَوْجُوْدًا فِی كُلِّ مَكَانٍ لَعَلَّكَ تَسْمَعُ نِدَاۤئِی فَقَدْ عَظُمَ جُرْمِیْ وَ قَلَّ حَیَاۤئِی مَوْلَایَ یَا مَوْلَایَ اَیَّ الْاَهْوَالِ اَتَذَكَّرُ وَ اَیَّهَا اَنْسٰی وَ لَوْ لَمْ یَكُنْ اِلَّا الْمَوْتُ لَكَفٰی كَیْفَ وَ مَا بَعْدَ الْمَوْتِ اَعْظَمُ وَ اَدْهٰی مَوْلَایَ یَا مَوْلَایَ حَتّٰی مَتٰی وَ اِلٰی مَتٰی اَقُوْلُ لَكَ الْعُتْبٰی مَرَّةً بَعْدَ اُخْرٰی ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ عِنْدِیْ صِدْقًا وَ لَا وَفَاۤءً فَیَا غَوْثَاهُ ثُمَّ وَا غَوْثَاهُ بِكَ یَاۤ اَللهُ مِنْ هَوًی قَدْ غَلَبَنِیْ وَ مِنْ عَدُوٍّ قَدِ اسْتَكْلَبَ عَلَیَّ وَ مِنْ دُنْیَا قَدْ تَزَیَّنَتْ لِیْ وَ مِنْ نَفْسِ اَمَّارَةٍ بِالسُّوْۤءِ اِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّیْ مَوْلَایَ یَا مَوْلَایَ اِنْ كُنْتَ رَحِمْتَ مِثْلِیْ فَارْحَمْنِیْ وَ اِنْ كُنْتَ قَبِلْتَ مِثْلِیْ فَاقْبَلْنِیْ یَا قَابِلَ السَّحَرَةِ اقْبَلْنِیْ یَا مَنْ لَمْ اَزَلْ اَتَعَرَّفُ مِنْهُ الْحُسْنٰی یَا مَنْ یُغَذِّیْنِیْ بِالنِّعَمِ صَبَاحًا وَ مَسَاۤءً اِرْحَمْنِیْ یَوْمَ اٰتِیْكَ فَرْدًا شَاخِصًا اِلَیْكَ بَصَرِیْ مُقَلَّدًا عَمَلِیْ قَدْ تَبَرَّاَ جَمِیْعُ الْخَلْقِ مِنِّیْ نَعَمْ وَ اَبِیْ وَ اُمِّیْ وَ مَنْ كَانَ لَهُ كَدِّیْ وَ سَعْیِیْ فَاِنْ لَمْ تَرْحَمْنِیْ فَمَنْ یَرْحَمُنِیْ وَ مَنْ یُؤْنِسُ فِی الْقَبْرِ وَحْشَتِیْ وَ مَنْ یُنْطِقُ لِسَانِیْ اِذَا خَلَوْتُ بِعَمَلِیْ وَ سَاَلْتَنِیْ عَمَّاۤ اَنْتَ اَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنِّیْ فَاِنْ قُلْتُ نَعَمْ فَاَیْنَ الْمَهْرَبُ مِنْ عَدْلِكَ وَ اِنْ قُلْتُ لَمْ اَفْعَلْ قُلْتَ اَ لَمْ اَكُنِ الشَّاهِدَ عَلَیْكَ فَعَفْوُكَ عَفْوُكَ یَا مَوْلَایَ قَبْلَ سَرَابِیْلِ الْقَطِرَانِ عَفْوُكَ عَفْوُكَ یَا مَوْلَایَ قَبْلَ جَهَنَّمَ وَ النِّیْرَانِ عَفْوُكَ عَفْوُكَ یَا مَوْلَایَ قَبْلَ اَنْ تُغَلَّ الْاَیْدِیْ اِلَی الْاَعْنَاقِ یَاۤ اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِیْنَ وَ خَیْرَ الْغَافِرِیْنَ۔--This supplicatory prayer will be mentioned in the appendixes of Mafatih al-Jinan.\r\n\r\nYou may then prostrate yourself and repeat the following doxology (zikr) five times:\r\n\r\n--سُبُّوْحٌ قُدُّوْسٌ، رَبُّ الْمَلَاۤئِكَةِ وَ الرُّوْحِ۔--You may then sit and recite Ayah al-Kursi after which you may return to the prostration position and repeat the aforesaid doxology (zikr) five times again.",

It is also desirable to pray Almighty Allah for the good of one's brethren-in-faith, for narrations have confirmed that one who prays for the good of forty of his friends shall have all his prayers responded.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Saduq, in his book of Man-La-Yahduruhul-Faqih, has recorded that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to say the following supplicatory prayer in the Watr Prayer:\r\n\r\nALLAAHUMMAH DENEE FEEMAN HADAYTA WA A'AFENEE FEEMAN A'AFAYTA WA TAWALLANEE FEEMAN TAWALLAYTA WA BAARIK LEE FEEMAN A-A'TAYTA WA QENEE SHARRA MAA QAZAYTA FA-INNAKA TAQZEYA WA LAA YUQZAA A'LAYKA SUBHAANAKA RABBAL BAYTE ASTAGHFEROKA WA ATOOBO ELAYKA WA OOMENO BEKA WA ATAWAKKALO A'LAYKA WA LAA HAWLA WA LAA QUWWATA ILLAA BEKA YAA RAHEEM.\r\n\r\nIt is also highly advisable to repeat the following imploration seventy times and, meanwhile, raise the left hand for supplicating and count with the right hand:\r\n\r\nASTAGHFERUL LAAHA RABBEE WA ATOOBO ELAYHE.\r\n\r\nIt is also narrated that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to implore for Almighty Allah's forgiveness seventy times during the Watr Prayer and then say the following statement:\r\n\r\nHAAZAA MAQAAMUL A'AEZE BEKA MENAN NAAR.\r\n\r\nIt is also narrated that Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin (a.s.) used to repeat the following word three hundred times during the Watr Prayer:\r\n\r\nAL-A'FWA AL-A'FWA.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the Imam (a.s.) would say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nRABBIGH FIRLEE ARHAMNEE WA ATOOBA A'LAIYYAA INNAKA ANTAT TAWWABUR RAHEEM.\r\n\r\nIt is highly advisable to extend your Qunut as long as possible. Thereafter, you go to the ritual genuflection of the prayer and when you raise your head, you should say the following supplicatory prayer that Shaykh al-Tusi, in his book of Tahdhib al-Ahkam, reports from Imam Musa ibn Ja'far al-Kazim (a.s.):\r\n\r\nHAAZAA MAQAAMO MAN HASANATOHU NE'MATUN MINKA WA SHUKROHU ZA-E'EFUN WA ZANBOHU A'ZEEMUN WA LAYSA LE-ZAALEKA ILLAA RIFQOKA WA RAHMATOKA FA-INNAKA QULTA FEE KETAABEKAL MUNZALE A'LAA NABIYYEKAL MURSALE SALLAL LAAHO A'LAYHE WA AALEHI KAANOO QALEELAN MENAL LAYLE MAA YAHJA-O'ONA WA BIL-ASHAARE HUM YASTAGHFEROONA TAALA HOJOO-E'E WA QALLA QEYAAMEE WA HAAZAS SAHARO WA ANAA ASTAGHFEROKA LE-ZONOOBEE ISTEGHFAARA MAN LAA YAJEDO LE-NAFSEHI ZARRAN WA LAA NAF-A'N WA LAA MAWTAN WA LAA HAYAATAN WA LAA NOSHOORAA.\r\n\r\nYou may then prostrate yourself and accomplish the prayer. After the accomplishment, you may say Tasbih al-Zahra'. After that, you may say the following:\r\n\r\nAL-HAMDO LE-RABBIS SABAAHE AL-HAMDO LE-FAALEQIL ISBAAHE.\r\n\r\nYou may then repeat the following three times:\r\n\r\nSUBHANA RABBEYAL MALEKIL QUDDOOSIL A'ZEEZIL HAKEEME\r\n\r\nYou may then say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nYAA HAYYO YAA QAYYOOMO YAA BARRO YAA RAHEEMO YAA GHANIYYO YAA KAREEMO URZUQNEE MENAT TEJAARATE A-A'ZAMAHAA FAZLAN WA AWSA-A'HAA RIZQAN WA KHAYRAHAA LEE A'AQEBATAN FA-INNAHU LAA KHAYRA FEEMAA LAA A'AQEBATA LAHU.\r\n\r\nIt is also highly advisable to say the following supplicatory prayer, which is called Dua e Hazeen (The Supplication of the Sad).\r\n\r\nYou may then prostrate yourself and repeat the following five times:\r\n\r\nSUBBOOHUN QUDDOOSUN RABBUL MALAAA-EKATE WAR ROOH.\r\n\r\nYou may then sit and recite Ayah al-Kursi after which you may return to the prostration position and repeat the aforesaid five times again.", 
    "english": "The following is an easy-to-do method of offering the Night Prayer that everyone can do:\r\n\r\nWhen you wake up at night, it is recommended to prostrate yourself before Almighty Allah. It is recommended that you say the following during or after the prostration:\r\n\r\nAll Praise be to Allah Who returned me to life after He had caused me to die, and to Him will be the Resurrection. All praise be to Allah Who gave me back my soul so that I will praise and worship Him.\r\n\r\nWhen you get up and stand up, say the following supplication:\r\n\r\nO Allah, help me pass the terror of the Resurrection Day, expand my burial place, and grant me all the good of the post-death stage.\r\n\r\nWhen you hear the sounds of roosters, say the following:\r\n\r\nGlorified and Sacred be You; Lord of the angels and the Holy Spirit. Your mercy has preceded Your wrath. There is no god save You. I have committed wrongdoings and wronged myself; so, forgive me, for none forgives sins save You; and accept my repentance, for You are the Oft-Returning, the All-merciful.\r\n\r\nWhen you raise your sight towards the sky, say the following supplication:\r\n\r\nO Allah, verily no still night, no sky displaying the zodiacal signs, no widely expansive land, no depths of darkness one above another, and no vast abysmal ocean that You cause to cover any of Your beings that You wish - none of all these can ever hide itself or anyone from You. You cover any of Your beings that You wish with mercy. You know the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal. All stars sink and all eyes sleep; but You are the Ever-living, the Self-Subsistent. Neither slumber nor sleep may ever overcome You. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds and the God of the Messengers. All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\r\n\r\nAfter that, you may recite the following five Quranic verses from Surah Al-'Imran (No. 3):\r\n\r\nLo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the difference of night and day are tokens for men of understanding. Such as remember Allah, standing, sitting, and reclining, and consider the creation of the heavens and the earth: Our Lord! You created not this in vain. Glory be to You! Preserve us from the doom of Fire. Our Lord! Whom You cause to enter the Fire: him indeed You have confounded. For evildoers, there will be no helpers. Our Lord! Lo! We have heard a crier calling unto Faith: \"Believe in your Lord!\" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefore forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous. Our Lord! And give us that which You have promised to us by Your messengers. Confound us not upon the Day of Resurrection. Lo! You break not the tryst.\r\n\r\nWhen you intend to take initiative to the night worship but you need to go to toilet, you may start with it. When you go out of toilet, cleanse your teeth with the traditional stick of Miswak. Afterward, you may perform the ritual ablution as completely as possible and then perfume and ready yourself for the Night Prayer.\r\n\r\nTHE TIME OF THE NIGHT PRAYER\r\n\r\nThe time of the Night Prayer begins after midnight; yet, it is recommended to perform it as near as possible to dawn. However, when dawn comes while one has still four units of the prayer to perform, one may recite only Surah al-Faatehah in the rest of the prayer.\r\n\r\nThe Night Prayer consists of eight units of prayer; each two alone. Taslim should be said at the end of each two units with the intention of offering the Night Prayer. It is advisable to repeat Surah al-Tawheed thirty times in each unit of the first couple after reciting Surah al-Faatehah.\r\n\r\nBy doing such, one's all sins will be forgiven as soon as he finishes the prayer. It is also recommended to recite (after Surah al-Faatehah) Surah al-Tawheed in the first unit and Surah al-Kafirun in the second.\r\n\r\nIn the other units of the prayer, one may recite any Surah he chooses. However, it is sufficiently acceptable to recite Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Tawheed in each unit of the Night Prayer. It is also permissible to recite Surah al-Faatehah alone.\r\n\r\nQUNUT\r\n\r\nLike obligatory prayers, it is highly recommended to practice Qunut in the second unit of each couple of the units of supererogatory prayers. At least, it is sufficient to repeat the following statement three times in Qunut:\r\n\r\nAll glory be to Allah\r\n\r\nIt is also sufficient to say this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO Allah, (please) forgive us, have mercy on us, grant us good health, and pardon us in this world as well as the world to come. You verily have power over all things.\r\n\r\nor this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO my Lord, forgive (me), have mercy (on me), and overlook that which You know for You are the All-glorious, the All-magnificent, and the All-generous.\r\n\r\nIt is narrated that Imam Musa ibn Ja'far al-Kazim (a.s.) used to say the following supplicatory prayer in his night worship:\r\n\r\nO Allah, You created me without fault, nurtured me when small...\r\n\r\nTHE SHAF' AND THE WATR PRAYERS\r\n\r\nWhen you accomplish the eight-unit Night Prayer, you may then offer the two-unit Shaf' Prayer and the one-unit Watr Prayer. In these three units, you are advised to recite, after Surah al-Faatehah, Surah al-Tawheed once so that you may be considered as having recited the entire Qur'an. Narrations have confirmed that Surah al-Tawheed is equivalent to one-third of the Holy Qur'an.\r\n\r\nYou may also recite in the first unit of the Shaf' Prayer Surah al-Nas (No. 114) and in the second Surah al-Falaq (No. 113).\r\n\r\nWhen you accomplish the Shaf' Prayer, you may say this supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO Allah! Tonight, the seekers of favors, restless and eager, present themselves to You, the determined aspirers have You in mind...\r\n\r\nThis supplicatory prayer has been mentioned in the book of Mafatih al-Jinan within the recommended acts on the fifteenth night of Sha'ban.\r\n\r\nUpon accomplishment of the Shaf' Prayer, you may stand up for offering the Watr Prayer. After Surah al-Faatehah, you may recite Surah al-Tawheed once or three times alone or with Surah al-Falaq and Surah al-Nas.\r\n\r\nYou may then raise your hands for Qunut and implore Almighty Allah for anything you desire.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Shaykh al-Tusi, the supplications for Qunut are too numerous to be counted. Generally, there are not definite supplications to be said in Qunut, for it is permissible to say anything.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended, during Qunut, to weep, or even try to weep, out of fear of Almighty Allah and fear of His chastisement. It is also desirable to pray Almighty Allah for the good of one's brethren-in-faith, for narrations have confirmed that one who prays for the good of forty of his friends shall have all his prayers responded.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Saduq, in his book of Man-La-Yahduruhul-Faqih, has recorded that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to say the following supplicatory prayer in the Watr Prayer:\r\n\r\nO Allah, (please) include me with those whom You have guided (to the right), include me with those whom You have granted good health, include me with those for whom You have cared, bless things that You have conferred upon me, and save me from the evil of what You have decided, for You decree and no one decrees against Your decree. All glory be to You, O Lord of the House. I implore for Your forgiveness, I repent before You, I have full faith in You, and I rely upon You totally. There in neither power nor might save with You, O All-merciful.\r\n\r\nIt is also highly advisable to repeat the following imploration seventy times and, meanwhile, raise the left hand for supplicating and count with the right hand:\r\n\r\nI implore Allah, my Lord, for forgiveness and I repent to Him.\r\n\r\nIt is also narrated that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to implore for Almighty Allah's forgiveness seventy times during the Watr Prayer and then say the following statement:\r\n\r\nThis is the situation of one who prays Your protection against Hellfire.\r\n\r\nIt is also narrated that Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin (a.s.) used to repeat the following word three hundred times during the Watr Prayer:\r\n\r\nPardon, Pardon.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the Imam (a.s.) would say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO my Lord, (please) forgive me, have mercy upon me, and accept my repentance, for You are surely the Oft-Returning, the All-forgiving, and the All-merciful.\r\n\r\nIt is highly advisable to extend your Qunut as long as possible. Thereafter, you go to the ritual genuflection of the prayer and when you raise your head, you should say the following supplicatory prayer that Shaykh al-Tusi, in his book of Tahdhib al-Ahkam, reports from Imam Musa ibn Ja'far al-Kazim (a.s.):\r\n\r\nThis is the situation of one whose good deeds are Your graces, whose thanksgiving is little, and whose sin is great; and nothing can settle all that except Your lenience and mercy for You have said in Your Book that is revealed to Your sent Prophet, peace be upon him and his Household: \"They were in the habit of sleeping but little by night; and in the hour of early dawn, they were found praying for forgiveness.\" Nevertheless, too much has been my sleep by night and too little has been my praying. This is the last hour of night and here I am imploring You to forgive my sins the imploration of one who cannot make for himself harm, benefit, death, life, or resurrection.\r\n\r\nYou may then prostrate yourself and accomplish the prayer. After the accomplishment, you may say Tasbih al-Zahra'. After that, you may say the following:\r\n\r\nAll praise be to the Lord of morning. All praise be to the Cleaver of daybreak.\r\n\r\nYou may then repeat the following three times:\r\n\r\nAll glory be to my Lord, the King, the All-holy, the All-mighty, the All-wise.\r\n\r\nYou may then say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO Ever-living! O Self-Subsistent! O Benign! O All-merciful! O Self-Sufficient! O All-generous! (Please) provide me commerce that is greatest in profit, most expansive in sustenance, and most profitable in end result, because any thing that lacks good end is worthless.\r\n\r\nIt is also highly advisable to say the following supplicatory prayer, which is called Dua e Hazeen (The Supplication of the Sad):\r\n\r\nI am calling at You, O He Who is Existent everywhere...\r\n\r\nYou may then prostrate yourself and repeat the following five times:\r\n\r\nGlorified and Sacred be You; Lord of the angels and the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nYou may then sit and recite Ayah al-Kursi after which you may return to the prostration position and repeat the aforesaid five times again."
