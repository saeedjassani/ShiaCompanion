In al-Risalah al-Fakhriyyah, Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin says that it is recommended to visit the tomb of Hamzah (‘a) as well as the tombs of the martyrs of the Battle of Uhud because the Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said, “He who visits my tomb but does not visit the tomb of my uncle Hamzah has in fact deserted me.”\r\n\r\nIn my book of Bayt al-Ahzan fi Masa’ib Sayyidat al-Niswan, I have mentioned that Lady Fatimah al-Zahra’ (‘a), after the demise of her father (‘a), used to visit the tomb of Hamzah and the other martyrs of the Battle of Uhud every Monday and Thursday. Until her demise, she (‘a) used to offer prayers and supplicate Almighty Allah there.\r\n\r\nMahmud ibn Labid says that Lady Fatimah al-Zahra’ (‘a) used to visit the tomb of Hamzah and weep there. One day, I visited the tomb of Hamzah and found her weeping. I therefore waited until she would stop. I then approached, greeted her, and said, “O Lady of all women, you have certainly broken my heart on account of your weeping.” She (‘a) answered, “O Abu-’Amr, I have had to experience the misfortune of losing the best of all fathers - the Messenger of Allah (‘a).” She (‘a) then added, “Oh! How I miss the Messenger of Allah! If one dies, his mention begins to fade away. But the mention of my father is always increasing.”\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Mufid says that the Holy Prophet (s), during his lifetime, ordered to visit the tomb of Hamzah frequently. He also used to respect this tomb as well as the tombs of the other martyrs. After the Holy Prophet’s demise, Lady Fatimah (‘a) very regularly visited Hamzah’s tomb, which used to be visited by the Muslims frequently.",
