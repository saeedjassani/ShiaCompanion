    "content": "Istikharah is the process of praying Almighty Allah for leading to the best option from among many options.\r\n\r\nWhen you are too confused to decide on a certain matter and you thus intend to ask Almighty Allah to lead you to the most suitable option, you may take six sheets of paper and write down the following on three of them:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ خِيَرَةٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ الْعَزِيْزِ الْحَكِيْمِ لِفُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانِ اِفْعَلْ۔--On the other three sheets of paper, you may write down the following:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ خِيَرَةٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ الْعَزيْزِ الْحَكِيْمِ لِفُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانِ اِفْعَلْ لَاتَفْعَلْ۔--You may then put all these sheets under your prayer-rug and offer a two-unit prayer. Upon accomplishment, you may prostrate yourself and repeat the following words one hundred times while prostrating:\r\n\r\n--اَسْتَخِيْرُ اللّٰهَ بِرَحْمَتِهِ خِيَرَةً فِىْ عَافِيَةٍ۔--You may then take the position of sitting and say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ خِرْلِىْ وَاخْتَرْلِىْ فِىْ جَمِيْعِ اُمُوْرِىْ فِىْ يُسْرٍ مِّنْكَ وَ عَافِيَةٍ۔--You may then put your hand on the sheets of paper and scatter them randomly and then take them out one by one. If the three sheets carrying the word “do it” come out in sequence, then you may do what you have intended to do. If the three sheets carrying the word “do it not” come out in sequence, then you must not do what you have intended to do. If the first sheet you pick up contains the word “do it” while the second contains the word “do it not”, then you must put all the sheets together again and pick up five sheets. If three out of these five sheets contain the word “do it”, then you must do what you have intended to do, and vice versa.",
