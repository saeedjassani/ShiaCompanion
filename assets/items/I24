    "content": "When you wish to go to bed, you must prepare yourself for meeting death. You must be in a state of ceremonial purity, repent from sinning, evacuate your heart from worldly affairs, bring to mind the end of your lifetime and the time when you will lie alone in your grave without having anyone to entertain you, put your last will under your pillow, and determine to wake up for offering the Night Prayer, which is the pride of the true faithful believer and its adornment in this world as well as the Hereafter. Before sleeping, you may recite Surah al-Tawheed, Surah al-Takathur, and Ayah al-Kursi. You may also repeat the following doxology (zikr) three times:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ عَلَافَقَهَرَ وَالْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ بَطَنَ فَخَبَرَ وَالْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ مَلَكَ فَقَدَرَ وَالْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ يُحْيِى الْمَوْتىٰ وَيُمِيْتُ الْاَحْيَاۤءَ وَ هُوَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيْرٌ۔--You may then say Tasbih al-Zahra’ and sleep on your right side, just like the dead in their graves. About sleeping like the moribund, our mentor Shaykh al-Nuri has said in his book of Dar al-Salam, “We could not find any report or tradition recommending so except something mentioned by al-Ghazzali. Of course, accuracy lies in opposing him.”\r\n\r\nIf you intend to wake up for offering the Night Prayer or another thing but you fear lest sleep overcomes you, you may recite the last holy verse of Surah al-Kahf (No. 18):\r\n\r\n--قُلْ اِنَّمَا اَ نَا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُكُمْ يُوْحىٰ اِلَىَّ اَنَّمَا اِلٰهُكُمْ اِلٰهٌ وَّاحِدٌ فَمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُوْ لِقَاۤءَ رَبِّهٖ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَايُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهٖ اَحَدًا۔--Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said that whoever recites this holy verse at sleeping will certainly wake up at the very time he wants.",
