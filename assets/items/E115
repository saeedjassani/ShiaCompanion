The Imam (‘a) then came out while he was uttering something. “Have you heard these words of mine?” the Imam (‘a) asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have. May Allah accept me as ransom for You!” answered Abu-Hamzah.\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) said, “I have been uttering some words that none says them but that Allah the All-exalted will save him from whatever distresses him, including the affairs of this world and the Next World.”\r\n\r\n“May Allah accept me as ransom for you.” said Abu-Hamzah, “Will you please teach me these words?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will,” responded the Imam (‘a), “Whoever says these words before leaving his house, all his matters that concern him will be made easy:”\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِیْمِ حَسْبِىَ اللهُ تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللهِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّىْۤ اَسْاَلُكَ خَيْرَ اُمُوْرِىْ كُلِّهَا،وَ اَعُوْزُ بِكَ مِنْ خِزْىِ الدُّنْيَا وَ عَذَابِ الْاٰخِرَةِ۔",
