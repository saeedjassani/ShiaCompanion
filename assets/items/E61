    "content": "Thirty-first: Shaykh Ibn Fahad has reported that when Abu’l-Darda’ was once informed that his house was on fire, he answered, “No, it is not on fire.” Another person met him and informed of the same, but Abu’l-Darda’ gave the same answer. The same answer he gave to a third person. Then, it was known that all the houses around Abu’l-Darda’’s house were consumed by fire except his. When he was asked how he knew that his house would not be on fire, Abu’l-Darda’ answered, “This is because I have heard the Messenger of Allah saying that whoever says this supplicatory prayer in the morning, no harm will afflict him that day, and whoever says it in evenings, no harm will attack him that night. Before I left, I had said this supplicatory prayer.”\r\n\r\nThis supplicatory prayer is as follows:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اَنْتَ رَبِّىْ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّاۤ اَنْتَ عَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَ اَنْتَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيْمِ وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَلَاقُوَّةَ اِلَّابِاللّٰهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ مَا شَاۤءَاللّٰهُ كَانَ وَ مَالَمْ يَشَاۤءْلَمْ يَكُنْ اَعْلَمُ اَنَّ اللّٰهَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَيْئٍ قَدِيْرٌ وَ اَنَّ اللّٰهَ قَدْ اَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَيْئٍ عِلْمًا اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّىْۤ اَعُوْذُبِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ نَفْسِىْ وَ مِنْ شَرِّ قَضَاۤءِ السُّوْۤءِ وَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ ذِىْ شَرٍّ وَ مِنْ شَرِّ الْجِنِّ وَ الْاِنْسِ وَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ اَنْتَ اٰخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَا اِنَّ رَبِّىْ عَلٰى صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيْمٍ۔",
