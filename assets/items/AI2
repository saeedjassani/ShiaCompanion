The least to mention in this respect is that this honorable mosque is one of the four mosques that are worthy of being visited so that the merits of such visit may be attained. It is also one of the four places where a traveler is free to perform the obligatory prayers either in the complete form (itmam) or in the shortened form (qasr). The reward of performing one obligatory prayer at Masjid al-Kufah is equal to the reward of going on one acceptable hajj and equal to the reward of performing one thousand prayers at other places.\r\n\r\nIn Masjid al-Kufah, according to narrations, all Prophets offered prayers, and the Awaited Imam - peace be upon him - will also offer prayer therein. In this connection, a hadith reads that one thousand Prophets and one thousand successors of Prophets offered prayers in Masjid al-Kufah. Moreover, some narrations may hint that this mosque is preferred in merits to the Holy Mosque in Jerusalem (al-masjid al-aqsa).\r\n\r\nIbn Qawlawayh has reported Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (‘a) as saying, “If people were to realize the favors that they may attain when they visit Masjid al-Kufah, they should certainly travel to it from remote countries One obligatory prayer in this mosque is equal in reward to (the reward of) one time of admitted hajj, and to offer a supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) (mustahab / nafilah) prayer in this mosque is equal in reward to (the reward of) one admitted ‘umrah.”\r\n\r\nHowever, according to another narration, the reward of one obligatory prayer and one supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) (mustahab / nafilah) prayer that are performed in Masjid al-Kufah is equal to the reward of one hajj and one ‘umrah practiced with the Holy Prophet (s).\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Kulayni, as well as other scholars, has reported on the authority of our master reporters that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) asked Harun ibn Kharijah, “What is the distance between your house and Masjid al-Kufah? Is it one mile?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Harun, “It is less than that.”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) asked, “Do you then perform all your prayers there?”\r\n\r\n“No, in fact” answered Harun.\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) commented, “Had I been present in the precinct of that mosque, I would have never missed any prayer that I can perform there. Do you know the merits of that place? All Prophets and virtuous saints offered prayers in Masjid al-Kufah, including the Holy Prophet Muhammad (s). When he was taken to the heavens, Archangel Gabriel said to him, ‘Muhammad, do you know where you are now? You are now opposite to the mosque of kufan.’ The Holy Prophet (s) thus asked permission from his Lord to visit the mosque and offer a two-unit prayer. He was thus permitted.\r\n\r\nVerily, the right side of this mosque is a garden of Paradise, the middle of it is a garden of Paradise, and the back of it is also a garden of Paradise. To perform an obligatory prayer there is equal in reward to performing one thousand prayers (at other places). To offer a supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) (mustahab / nafilah) prayer therein is equal in reward to offering five hundred prayers. To sit there without reciting or saying any devotional statement is considered worship. If people were to realize the merits of visiting this place, they would certainly come to it, even crawling.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another narration, the reward of one obligatory prayer that is performed in Masjid al-Kufah is equal to the reward of going on hajj, and the reward of one supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) (mustahab / nafilah) prayer that is offered there is equal to the reward of one ‘umrah.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the previously mentioned seventh untimed form of ziyarah of Imam ‘Ali (‘a), I have also referred to some merits of Masjid al-Kufah.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the word of some narrations, the right side of this mosque is more favorable than its left side.",
