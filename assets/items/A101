    "content": "SURAH AL-QADR (THE MAJESTY)\r\n\r\nThis is a ‘Makki’ Surah with 5 ayaat. Imam Mohammad al-Baqir (a.s.) has said that whoever recites this Surah with a loud voice, it is as if he has lifted his sword to fight in the way of Allah (S.w.T.) and whoever recites it slowly in his mind, it is as if he has been sacrificed in the way of Allah and has died a martyr.\r\n\r\nIf a person recites this Surah ten times, one thousand sins of his are forgiven. If recited in compulsory prayers, all previous sins are forgiven. It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (S) that reciting this Surah once carries the reward of fasting for the whole month of Ramadhan. Constant recitation of this Surah, increases sustenance.\r\n\r\nIf Surah Qadr is recited 11 times before sleeping, the reciter remains safe the whole night. Recitation in front of an enemy keeps one safe from his evil designs. For the paying back of loans, one should seek forgiveness and should recite Surah Qadr as many times as possible.\r\n\r\nImam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) said that for pious children, one should keep his right hand on his wife and recite this Surah 7 times before going into her. If recited seven times on the grave of a believer, his sins will be forgiven.\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ--اِنَّاۤ اَنْزَلْنٰهُ فِىْ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ ۖ ۚ‏(1)--وَمَاۤ اَدْرٰٮكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِؕ‏(2)--لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ  ۙ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ اَلْفِ شَهْرٍؕ‏(3)--تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلٰٓئِكَةُ وَالرُّوْحُ فِيْهَا بِاِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ‌ۚ مِّنْ كُلِّ اَمْرٍ ۛۙ‏(4)--سَلٰمٌ   ۛهِىَ حَتّٰى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ‏(5)",
