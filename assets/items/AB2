According to a tradition that is reported from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), one who practices acts of worship at this night will have the reward of one hundred fasters who confine themselves to mosques and who have never disobeyed Almighty Allah. Accordingly, it is highly advisable to seize this excellent opportunity and practice acts of worship and obedience, offer prayers, and pray Almighty Allah for granting one’s needs. In this respect, it has been narrated that Almighty Allah will respond to one who prays Him for any need at this night.\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-THIRD OF DHU’L-QA’DAH\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of Dhu’l-Qa’dah, AH 200, Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Rida(a.s.) departed life, according to some narrations. Hence, it is familiar to visit his tomb on this day whether from nearby or from far off. In this respect, Sayyid Ibn Tawus, in Iqbal al-A’mal, says that he has seen in the book of some non-Arab scholars that it is recommended to visit the holy tomb of Imam al-Rida(a.s.) on the twenty-third of Dhu’l-Qa’dah from nearby or from far off by one of the familiar forms of Ziyarah or any other form.",
