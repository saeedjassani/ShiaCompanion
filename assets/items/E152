As he asked about the lord of that tent, he was answered that it was owned by Imam al-Mahdi, the Awaited - the protecting shelter and the relief of the deprived ones - may Allah hasten his reappearance. He therefore hurried towards that tent and complained about his poverty, asking the Imam (a.s.) to teach him a supplication that would relieve him from his grief and save him from his misfortunes. The Imam, having heard his complaint, instructed him to visit the tent of one of his offspring. He therefore left the Imam’s tent and headed for the tent to which he was guided. When he reached there, he saw Sayyid Muhammad al-Sultanabadi sitting in his prayer-place while he was engaged in uttering supplications and litanies. He greeted him and told him about his story with the Imam. The Sayyid therefore taught him a supplication that would relieve him from poverty and bring him good sustenance.\r\n\r\nWhen the man woke up, he found that he had learnt that supplication by heart; therefore, he hurried to the house of the Sayyid and found him in the same state that he had seen in the dream. As if the Sayyid had already known about the dream, he welcomed the man and smiled in his face. The man hence asked the Sayyid about that supplication and the Sayyid answered him. Immediately after saying the supplication persistently, the man became so wealthy that fortune covered him from all sides.\r\n\r\nHajjFathAli al-Sultanabadi used to praise the Sayyid so laudably. For some time, he studied under him.\r\n\r\nThe following three matters were taught by the Sayyid to that man:\r\n\r\n(1) He taught him that he, after the dawn (fajr) Prayers, should put his hand on his chest and repeat seventy times the phrase of:\r\n\r\n--يَا فَتَّاحُ--(2) He taught him to regularly say the following supplicatory prayer that, as is recorded in al-Kafi, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) taught to one of his companions who had been afflicted by disease and poverty. Soon after that, the man recovered health and got rid of poverty. The supplication is this:\r\n\r\n--لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى الْحَيِّ الَّذِيْ لَا يَمُوْتُ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِيْ لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ شَرِيْكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ الذُّلِّ وَ كَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيْرًا۔--(3) He taught him to say the abovementioned supplication, which is recorded by Ibn Fahad al-Hilli in ‘Uddat al-Dai, after the dawn (fajr) Prayers.\r\n\r\nIt is thus necessary to constantly say these supplications since great rewards will be given to those who do not neglect so.",
