It is also allowable for a visitor to do the rites of ziyarah on behalf of another person. This has been reported, through a valid chain of authority, from Dawud al-Sarami who, once, said to Imam ‘Ali al-Naqi (al-Hadi), “I have visited (the tomb of) your father and dedicated the reward to you.”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) commented, “From Allah, you shall be endued great return and reward; and from us, you will be given thanks.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another tradition, Imam ‘Ali al-Hadi (‘a) deputized an individual to travel to the tomb of Imam al-Husayn (‘a) to visit the tomb and pray Almighty Allah there.\r\n\r\nThrough a valid chain of authority, Imam Musa ibn Ja’far (‘a) is reported to have instructed the following:\r\n\r\nIf you come to the tomb of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his Household, and carry out what is obligatory upon you to do there, you may then offer a two-unit prayer, stop at the side of the Holy Prophet’s head, and say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا نَبِيَّ اللّٰهِ مِنْ اَبِيْ وَ اُمِّيْ وَ زَوْجَتِيْ وَ وَلَدِيْ وَ حَآمَّتِيْ وَ مِنْ جَمِيْعِ اَهْلِ بَلَدِيْ حُرِّهِمْ وَ عَبْدِهِمْ وَ اَبْيَضِهِمْ وَ اَسْوَدِهِمْ۔--If you do so, then you can honestly tell every one you meet that you have conveyed his greetings to the Holy Prophet (s).\r\n\r\nAccording to some traditions, one of the Holy Imams was asked, “When a person offers a two-unit prayer, observes fasting on a day, goes on the ritual hajj or ‘umrah, or visits the tomb of the Holy Prophet or one of the Holy Imams, and then dedicates the reward of that act to his parents or one of his brothers-in-faith, will that person be rewarded for that?”\r\n\r\nThe Imam answered, “The reward of that act will reach the person to whom it has been dedicated without reducing any amount of the reward decided to the person who has performed that act.”\r\n\r\nIn Tahdhib al-Ahkam, Shaykh al-Tusi states: He who has traveled for visiting a holy shrine on behalf of a brother-in-faith of him may say the following words upon accomplishing the rites of the ziyarah:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ مَاۤ اَصَابَنِيْ مِنْ تَعَبٍ اَوْ نَصَبٍ اَوْ شَعَثٍ اَوْ لُغُوْبٍ فَأْجُرْ فُلَانَ بْنَ فُلَانٍ فِيْهِ وَ أْجُرْنِيْ فِيْ قَضَاۤئِيْ عَنْهُ۔--When he greets the visited Imam, he may say the following words after that:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا مَوْلَايَ عَنْ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانٍ اَتَيْتُكَ زَاۤئِرًا عَنْهُ فَاشْفَعْ لَهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ۔--He may then pray Almighty Allah for whatever he wishes.\r\n\r\nA visitor who is deputized by another to perform the rites of ziyarah on behalf of him may say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّ فُلَانَ بْنَ فُلَانٍ اَوْفَدَنِيْۤ اِلٰى مَوَالِيْهِ وَ مَوَالِيَّ لِاَزُوْرَ عَنْهُ رَجَاۤءً لِجَزِيْلِ الثَّوَابِ وَ فِرَارًا مِنْ سُوْۤءِ الْحِسَابِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّهُ يَتَوَجَّهُ اِلَيْكَ
