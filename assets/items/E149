He was imprisoned at al-Zariqi, al-Mutawakkil’s chamberlain. When I was permitted to visit this chamberlain, he asked me, “O Saqr! What for are you here?”\r\n\r\n“I am here for a good matter,” I answered.\r\n\r\nThe chamberlain then asked me to sit down. When I did, we discussed the public affairs until he asked all the others to leave him. When we remained alone, he asked me,\r\n\r\n“Tell me the truth! What for are you here and what has brought you?”\r\n\r\n“I am here for a good matter,” I answered.\r\n\r\nHe then said to me, “Perhaps, you have come here to see your master.”\r\n\r\n“My master is the Prince of the Faithful (i.e. the ruler),” I answered.\r\n\r\nBut the chamberlain said to me, “Shut up! Your real master is the Truth. Do not fear from me. I also follow the same faith you follow.”\r\n\r\nI thus expressed my thanks to Almighty Allah.\r\n\r\nHe then asked me whether I would like to see the Imam (a.s.) and I answered in the affirmative. Yet, he asked me to wait until the mailman would leave.\r\n\r\nWhen the man left, the chamberlain ordered one of the servants to take me from the hand and lead me inside a certain room.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered, I found the Imam (a.s.) sitting on a rug next to which there was a ready grave. After he responded to my salutation, the Imam (a.s.) allowed me to sit down and then asked me the reason why I was there.\r\n\r\n“I am here to investigate your manner,” I said.\r\n\r\nAs my eyes fell on the grave, I wept. The Imam (a.s.) looked at me and said, “Saqr! Do not be upset. They will not be able to hurt me.”\r\n\r\nI thus praised and thanked Almighty Allah and said, “O my master! There is a Hadith reported from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) whose meaning is not known by me.”\r\n\r\n“What is that Hadith?” asked the Imam.\r\n\r\nI mentioned the Hadith that reads, “Do not provoke the hostility of the Days otherwise they will be your enemies.”\r\n\r\nExplaining to me, the holy Imam (a.s.) said, “Verily, we are the Days so long as the heavens and the earth endure. Saturday is the name of the Messenger of Allah, Sunday the name of Ameer al-Momineen Imam Ali, Monday the name of the Imams al-Hasan and al-Husayn, Tuesday the names of Ali ibn al-Husayn (Imam Zayn al-’Abidin), Muhammad ibn Ali (Imam al-Baqir) and Ja’far ibn Muhammad (Imam al-Sadiq), Wednesday the names of Musa ibn Ja’far (Imam al-Kazim), Ali ibn Musa (Imam al-Rida), Muhammad ibn Ali (Imam al-Jawad) and me, Thursday the name of my son al-Hasan ibn Ali, and Friday the name of my grandson (Imam al-Mahdi). On Friday will the group of the Truth join him. This is the meaning of the Days. You thus should not provoke their hostility in this world; otherwise, they will be your enemies in the Next World.”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (a.s.) then asked me to bid farewell and leave.\r\n\r\nSayyid Ibn Tawus has narrated the same narration in another series of reporters on the authority of al-Qutb al-Rawandi with the following details:",
