However, it is not certain that this form is dedicated to this day. This form of ziyarah is in fact composed of two forms that ‘Allamah al-Majlisi has mentioned them in his book of al-Tuhfah as the second and the third forms of ziyarah dedicated to the Ghadir Day.",

O Allah, I bear witness that he conveyed all that which has been entrusted with him on behalf of Your Prophet, peace be upon him and his Household, conformed to that which has been kept with him, held that which has been commended to him, observed that which You have deemed lawful, forbade that which You have deemed unlawful, carried out Your laws, called unto Your course, he assisted Your saints, incurred the hostility of Your enemies, and strove against those who preached Your path, those who acted wrongly, and those who apostatized Your affair. In all these, he was steadfast, seeking Your pleasure, advancing, and never neglectful. No censure has ever precluded him from what he would do for Your sake until he attained Your satisfaction, relegated all matters to You, worshipped You sincerely, and acted sincerely and painstakingly for Your sake until death came upon him. So, You grasped his soul to You while he was happy martyr, saint, pious, pleased, pure, guide, and well-guided. O Allah, (please do) bless Muhammad and bless him with the best blessings You have ever bestowed upon any of Your Prophets and select ones, O Lord of the worlds.\r\n\r\nIn his book of Misbah alZa’ir, Sayyid Ibn Tawus has mentioned another form of ziyarah that is dedicated to this day (Ghadir Day).
