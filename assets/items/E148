In this connection, Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Rida(a.s.) is reported to have said that one may repeat one hundred times one of the following words during the Thanksgiving Prostrations:\r\n\r\n--«شُكْرًا شُكْرًا» «عَفْوًا عَفْوًا»--Imam al-Rida(a.s.) is also reported to have said: The least to be said while prostrating is to repeat the following three times:\r\n\r\n--«شُكْرًا لِلّٰهِ»",
