If the result of little tendency to the wrongdoers is Hellfire and loss of any supporter against Almighty Allah, then what should the case be with those who commit excessive tendency towards them?\r\n\r\nOther exegetes of the Holy Qur’an maintain that inclination towards the wrongdoers stand for having a role in their acts of injustice and in their wrongdoings, showing approval of their deeds, and showing loyalty to them.\r\n\r\nThe Ahl al-Bayt (‘a) are reported to have said, “Inclination towards the wrongdoers stands for bearing love for them, acting towards them sincerely, and obeying them.”",
