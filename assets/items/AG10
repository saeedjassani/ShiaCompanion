Reporting a great reward for those who visit Imam al-Husayn with this form of Ziyarah, Ibn Tawus, having overlooked the chain of authority, reported that Jabir al-Ju’fi said that Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) asked him, “What is the distance between your house and the tomb of al-Husayn?”\r\n\r\nJabir answered, “May Allah accept my father and mother as ransoms for you! It is only a day and half a day (walking).”\r\n\r\n“Do you usually visit him?” the Imam (‘a) asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” answered Jabir.\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) then said to him, “May I convey to you good tidings? May I delight you by informing you some of the rewards of visiting his tomb?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you may,” answered Jabir.\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) thus said, “Once you provide yourselves with supplies of travel and prepare yourselves for visiting Imam al-Husayn (‘a), the inhabitants of the heavens convey this glad tiding to each other. As soon as you leave the door of your houses and ride or walk, Almighty Allah appoints four thousand angels to bless you until you arrive at Imam al-Husayn’s tomb. When you arrive at the tomb of al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (‘a), you may stop at the gate and say these words, because you shall be granted a portion of Allah’s mercy for each word you utter... These are the words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ اٰدَمَ صَفْوَةِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ نُوْحٍ نَبِيِّ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ اِبْرَاهِيْمَ خَلِيْلِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ مُوْسٰى كَلِيْمِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ عِيْسٰى رُوْحِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ مُحَمَّدٍ سَيِّدِ رُسُلِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ عَلِيٍّ اَمِيْرِ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ وَ خَيْرِ الْوَصِيِّيْنَ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَارِثَ الْحَسَنِ الرَّضِيِّ الطَّاهِرِ الرَّاضِي الْمَرْضِيِّ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الصِّدِّيْقُ الْاَكْبَرُ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الْوَصِيُّ الْبَرُّ التَّقِيُّ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ وَ عَلَى الْاَرْوَاحِ الَّتِيْ حَلَّتْ بِفِنَاۤئِكَ وَ اَنَاخَتْ بِرَحْلِكَ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ وَ عَلَى الْمَلَاۤئِكَةِ الْحَآفِّيْنَ بِكَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ اَقَمْتَ الصَّلَاةَ وَ اٰتَيْتَ الزَّكَاةَ وَ اَمَرْتَ بِالْمَعْرُوْفِ وَ نَهَيْتَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَ جَاهَدْتَ الْمُلْحِدِيْنَ وَ عَبَدْتَ اللّٰهَ حَتّٰى اَتَاكَ الْيَقِيْنُ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ،--You may then walk towards the tomb. With each step you make, you will be awarded the reward of one who sacrifices his blood for the sake of Allah. When you approach the tomb, you may wipe your hand over it and say these words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حُجَّةَ اللهِ فِىۤ اَرْضِهِ‏--You may then go for offering the prayer. For each unit of prayer that you offer near the tomb, you will have the reward of one who went one thousand times on hajj and one thousand times on ‘umrah, manumitted one thousand slaves for the sake of Allah, and stood in the line of a missioned Prophet one thousand times.”\r\n\r\nThis tradition has been previously mentioned within the etiquettes of visiting Imam al-Husayn’s tomb, yet with little difference in paragraphs and in reporter, who has been al-Mufazzal ibn ‘Umar.",
