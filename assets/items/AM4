    "content": "As long as he is in Baghdad, a visitor is also advised to visit the tomb of Muhammad ibn Ya’qub al-Kulayni, may Allah perfume his tomb, the most sublime, splendid, and trustworthy religius personality. In his time, he was the most trustworthy and versed chief of the Shi’ah in the field of reporting of traditions. In a period of twenty years, he compiled his famous book entitled al-Kafi - such a precious book that has delighted the eyes of all the Shi’ah. Moreover, his book is considered a favor that has been done to the Shi’ah in general and Shi’ite scholars in particular. Ibn al-Athir has regarded Shaykh al-Kulayni as the reviviscent of the Imamiyyah Sect in the third century after he has regarded our master the Eighth Imam (al-Rida) as the reviviscent of the Sect in the second century.\r\n\r\nIn my book of Hadiyyat al-Za’ir, I have listed the names of the scholars buried in these holy shrines. To acquaint oneself with this piece of information, the gentle reader may refer to that book.",
