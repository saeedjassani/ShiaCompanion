Likewise, too many are the traditions demonstrating the merits of saying such supplications after the dawn (fajr) Prayers. In this connection, Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) is reported to have said, “To supplicate and mention Almighty Allah in the space of time between dawn (fajr) Prayer and sunrise brings about sustenance swifter than going about in the lands.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is reported to have said, “He that sits in his prayer-place, supplicating and mentioning Almighty Allah from the dawn (fajr) Prayer up to sunrise will be hidden by Almighty Allah from Hellfire.”\r\n\r\nImam al-Baqir (a.s.) is reported to have said, “Iblis (i.e. Satan) deploys his troops, the troops of daylight, in the space of time between dawn (fajr) and sunrise. As for his troops of night, he deploys them in the space of time between sunset and the vanishing of the western redness of the sun. Therefore, you should mention Almighty Allah at these two times very frequently, for Iblis exerts all his efforts at these two times to distract man from mentioning Almighty Allah.”\r\n\r\nThrough an authentic chain of authority, it is reported that Imam al-Rida(a.s.), during his stay in Khurasan, used to sit in his prayer-place, after he would perform the dawn (fajr) Prayer, mentioning and supplicating Almighty Allah up to sunrise. Then, a piece of cloth containing some teeth-brushing sticks would be brought to him and he would use them one by one. He would then chew some gum before he would start reciting the Glorious Book of Allah.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is reported to have said, “He who sits in his prayer-place where he performed the dawn (fajr) Prayer, mentioning Almighty Allah up to sunrise, will be granted the reward of going on pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah.”\r\n\r\nAccording to a Word of Sacredness (hadith qudsi), Allah the All-exalted says, “O son of Adam, remember Me an hour after morning and an hour after afternoon so that I will settle on behalf of you whatever has concerned you.”\r\n\r\nThe post-dawn (fajr) Prayer utterances are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: Ibn Baabwayh has reported through a valid chain of authority that Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) said, “He who repeats the imploration for Almighty Allah’s forgiveness seventy times after the dawn (fajr) Prayer will be forgiven by Almighty Allah even if he would commit seventy (or seven hundred according to another narration) sins on that day.”\r\n\r\nSecond: Ibn Baabwayh has also reported through an authentic chain of authority and other valid chain of authority that Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) said, “He who performs the dawn (fajr) Prayer and follows it with reciting Surah al-Tawheed eleven times will not be followed by any sin to commit even if Satan may be averse.”\r\n\r\nIn the book of al-Balad al-Amin, it is mentioned that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said, “He who recites Surah al-Tawheed ten times every day will not be followed by any sin to commit even if Satan exerts all efforts against so.”\r\n\r\nThird: Al-Kulayni has reported though an authentic chain of authority that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) said: He who repeats the following doxology (zikr) one hundred times after the dawn (fajr) Prayer will not face any terrible thing on that day:\r\n\r\n--مَاشَاۤءَاللّٰهُ كَانَ لَاحَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔--The same narration is reported by al-Tusi and others in their books on supplications.",
