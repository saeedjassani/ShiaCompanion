    "content": "Fifth: It is recommended to begin with offering the famous Salat Salman (The Prayer of Salman al-Farisi), which consists of thirty units. On the first of Rajab, it is advisable to offer ten units of this prayer separating each couple with a Taslim. In each unit, one should recite Surah al-Faatehah one time, Surah al-Tawheed three times, and Surah al-Kafirun three times. After Taslim, it is recommended to raise the hands up and say the following litany:\r\n\r\n--لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَ لَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِيْ وَ يُمِيْتُ وَ هُوَ حَيٌّ لَا يَمُوْتُ بِيَدِهِ الْخَيْرُ وَ هُوَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَيْ‏ءٍ قَدِيْرٌ۔--The following litany should be said thereafter:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا اَعْطَيْتَ وَ لَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ وَ لَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَدُّ۔--Then, one should pass the hands over the face.\r\n\r\nOther ten units of this prayer should be offered on the fifteenth (i.e. middle) of Rajab in the very aforementioned form and litanies. However, the following litany should be added after the first one:\r\n\r\n--اِلَهًا وَاحِدًا اَحَدًا فَرْدًا صَمَدًا لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ صَاحِبَةً وَ لَا وَلَدًا۔--The last ten units of this prayer should be offered on the last day of Rajab in this very form; rather, the following litany is added after the first one:\r\n\r\n--وَ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِهِ الطَّاهِرِيْنَ وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔--Then, one should pass the hands over the face and submit his requests.\r\n\r\nThis greatly advantageous prayer must not be neglected. However, Salman has another prayer, to be offered on this day, which consists of ten units in each of which Surah al-Faatehah should be recited once and Surah al-Tawheed three times. This prayer brings about a great reward; it achieves forgiveness of all sins, protects against the grave torture and the chastisement on the Resurrection Day, and saves from leprosy, elephantiasis, and pleurisy.\r\n\r\nSayyid Ibn Tawus has also mentioned, in his book of Iqbal al-A’mal, another prayer that is offered on the first of Rajab.\r\n\r\nAccording to some narrations, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) was born on the first of Rajab, AH 57. Yet, I believe that his birth was on the third of Safar.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND OF RAJAB\r\n\r\nAccording to some narrations, Imam Ali al-Hadi al-Naqi(a.s.) was born on the second of Rajab, AH 212. He departed life on the third of Rajab, AH 254, in Surra-man-Ra’a (currently Samarra’, Iraq).\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH OF RAJAB\r\n\r\nOn the word of Ibn ‘Ayyash, Imam Muhammad al-Jawad al-Taqi(a.s.) was born on the tenth of Rajab.",
