Verily, in the root and branches of these trees is an amulet against distress and sorcery. In the grains of this plant, there is remedy of seventy-two maladies. So, treat yourselves with this plant and with olibanum.”\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY\r\n\r\nIt is reported that when Imam al-Rida(a.s.) once passed by an epileptic person, he ordered a cup of water to be brought to him. The Imam (a.s.) then recited Surah al-Faatehah, Surah al-Falaq, and Surah al-Nas on the cup and expectorated in it. He then ordered them to pour that water on the head and face of the epileptic person. Immediately, the man restored consciousness. The Imam (a.s.) then said to him, “This will never affect you again.”\r\n\r\nREPELLING THE EVILS OF JINN\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is reported to have said: Whoever is thrown by a jinni with a stone, may pick up the stone, throw it to the direction from which it came, and say this:\r\n\r\n--حَسْبِىَ اللّٰهُ وَ كَفٰى وَ سَمِعَ اللّٰهُ لِمَنْ دَعَا لَيْسَ وَرَاۤءَ اللّٰهِ مُنْتَهٰى۔--To secure oneself from jinn, it is useful to breed chickens, roosters, and young goats in one’s house.\r\n\r\nTo secure oneself from jinn in journeys, wastelands, and places expected to be haunted, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have advised that one should put his hand on the center of the head and recite the following holy verse with the lowest tone:\r\n\r\n--اَفَغَيْرَ دِيْنِ اللّٰهِ يَبْغُوْنَ وَ لَهُ اَسْلَمَ مَنْ فِى السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْاَرْضِ طَوْعًا وَ كَرْهًا وَّ اِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُوْنَ۔--It is also reported that when the lands expected to be haunted are entered, it is advisable to utter the adhan.",
