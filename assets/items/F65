We live in the desert away from al-Madinah and it is unfeasible for us to present ourselves every Friday before you. I therefore want you to teach me an act, which collects the rewards of performing the Friday Prayers so that, when I leave for my people, I will teach them to do it.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said:\r\n\r\nWhen the daylight rises up, you should offer a two-unit prayer. In the first unit, you may recite Surah al-Faatehah once and repeat Surah al-Falaq seven times. In the second unit, you may recite Surah al-Faatehah once and repeat Surah al-Nas seven times. When you accomplish the prayer (by saying the Taslim statement), you may recite Ayah al-Kursi seven times. After that, you should stand up to offer eight units of prayer with two Taslim statements. After every couple of units, you may sit (for a while) but do not say the Taslim statement. When you accomplish offering four units of prayer, you should say the Taslim statement and then stand up for offering the other four units as same as you have just done. In each unit, you may recite Surah al-Faatehah once, Surah al-Nasr once, and Surah al-Tawheed twenty-five times. If you accomplish these four units, you may say the tashahhud and Taslim statements and repeat the following supplicatory prayer seven times:\r\n\r\n--يَا حَىُّ يَا قَيُّوْمُ يَا ذَاالْجَلَالِ وَالْاِكْرَامِ يَا اِلٰهَ الْاَوَّلِيْنَ وَ الْاٰ خِرِيْنَ يَا اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ يَا رَحْمٰنَ الدُّنْيَا وَ الْاٰ خِرَةِ وَ رَحِيْمَهُمَا يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِهٖ وَاغْفِرْلِىْ۔--You can now mention what you need.\r\n\r\nRepeat the following litany seventy times:\r\n\r\n--لَاحَوْلَ وَلَاقُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيْمِ۔--Then say the following:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيْمِ۔--I swear by Him Who has sent me and chosen me in truth, I will certainly guarantee Paradise for any believer, man or woman, who offers this prayer as exactly as I have explained. Moreover, he who offers this prayer will not leave his place before Almighty Allah has forgiven his and his parents sins, given him the reward of every individual who performed a prayer in all regions of Muslims, recorded for him the reward of every individual in the east and the west of the earth who observed fasting and offered prayers on that day, and given him rewards that no eye could ever saw and no ear could ever heard.\r\n\r\nIn his book of Misbah al-Mutahajjid, al-Tusi has explained this prayer, yet he has not mentioned the aforesaid supplicatory prayer; rather, he said that when you finish the prayer, you may repeat the following statements seventy times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيْمِ وَلَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔",
