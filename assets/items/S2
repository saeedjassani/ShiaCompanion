According to some narrations, on this day in AH 61, the head of Imam al-Husayn, the chief of martyrs, entered the city of Damascus, the capital of the Umayyad rulers, on spearheads after it had been carried to it from al-Kufah, Iraq. Therefore, the Umayyads betook that day as feast day. A poet says,\r\n\r\n--كَانَتْ مَاٰتِمُ بِالْعِرَاقِ تَعُدُّهَا اَمَوِيَّةٌ بِالشَّامِ مِنْ اَعْيَادِهَا--In fact, on this day, the grievances of Imam al-Husayn’s adherents should be aroused.\r\n\r\nAccording to some narrations, on the first, or the third, of Safar, Zayd ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn was martyred.",
