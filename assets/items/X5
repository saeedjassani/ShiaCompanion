We are now in Rajab; I therefore please you to teach me a supplicatory prayer due to which Almighty Allah may help me.” Hence, the Imam (a.s.) asked him to write down the following:\r\n\r\nIn the Name of Allah, the All-Beneficent the All-Merciful. You may say the following (supplicatory prayer) each day in Rajab; in mornings, evenings, and after each of the obligatory prayers:\r\n\r\n--يَا مَنْ اَرْجُوْهُ لِكُلِّ خَيْرٍ وَ آمَنُ سَخَطَهُ عِنْدَ كُلِّ شَرٍّ يَا مَنْ يُعْطِيْ الْكَثِيْرَ بِالْقَلِيْلِ يَا مَنْ يُعْطِيْ مَنْ سَاَلَهُ يَا مَنْ يُعْطِيْ مَنْ لَمْ يَسْاَلْهُ وَ مَنْ لَمْ يَعْرِفْهُ تَحَنُّنًا مِنْهُ وَ رَحْمَةً اَعْطِنِيْ بِمَسْاَلَتِيْ اِيَّاكَ جَمِيْعَ خَيْرِ الدُّنْيَا وَ جَمِيْعَ خَيْرِ الْآخِرَةِ وَ اصْرِفْ عَنِّيْ بِمَسْاَلَتِيْ اِيَّاكَ جَمِيْعَ شَرِّ الدُّنْيَا وَ شَرِّ الْآخِرَةِ فَاِنَّهُ غَيْرُ مَنْقُوْصٍ مَا اَعْطَيْتَ وَ زِدْنِي مِنْ فَضْلِكَ يَا كَرِيْمُ۔--The narrator then added that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) then grasped his beard with his left hand, while saying this supplicatory prayer, and moved ceaselessly the forefinger of his right hand. He then added:\r\n\r\n--يَا ذَا الْجَلَالِ وَ الْاِكْرَامِ يَا ذَا النَّعْمَاءِ وَ الْجُوْدِ يَا ذَا الْمَنِّ وَ الطَّوْلِ حَرِّمْ شَيْبَتِي عَلَى النَّارِ۔--Ninth: The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is reported as saying: Whoever repeats the following imploration for forgiveness one hundred times in Rajab and immediately gives alms after it, Almighty Allah will conclude his life with mercy and forgiveness.
