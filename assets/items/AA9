It has been narrated by Sayyid Ibn Tawus in al-Iqbal who said that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) used to say this supplicatory prayer after the Maghrib (sunset) Prayers in Ramadan. Moreover, Shaykh al-Kaf’ami, in al-Balad al-Amin, has narrated that it is recommended to say this supplicatory prayer every day in Ramadan and especially at the first night of it. As to Shaykh al-Mufid, he, in his book of al-Muqni’ah, has mentioned that this supplicatory prayer is exclusively said at the first night of Ramadan after the Maghrib Prayer.",

If others beg people for settling their needs, I ask none except You for settling my need; from You alone, since You have no partner with You. I thus implore You in the name of Your favor and Your pleasure, to send blessings to Muhammad and his Household and to choose for me a way to Your Holy House this year: a pilgrimage that is admitted, accepted, pure, and sincerely intended for You by which You delight me and raise my rank with You. Confer upon me with the grace of making me cast my sight down (against what is illegal for me to look at), making me act chastely, and making me stop committing any deed that You have deemed unlawful so that nothing will be more preferred in my sight than obedience to You, fear of You, doing all that which You love, and avoiding all that which You have detested and warned against. (Please) make all that take place with easiness, lenience, and good health as well as the grace that You have bestowed upon me. I beseech You to cause me to die as martyr for Your sake, under the pennon of Your Prophet and in the line of Your intimate servants. I ask You to make me a means of killing Your enemies and the enemies of Your Messenger. I ask You to honor me through humiliating any one of Your created beings that You choose, and not to humiliate me through honoring any of Your intimate servants. O Allah, find me a way with the Messenger. Allah is Sufficient unto me! Only that which Allah wants shall take place.\r\n\r\nThis supplication is called Dua al-Hajj.
