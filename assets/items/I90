    "content": "Eighth: Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) is also reported to have said, “If you recite Surah al-Fatihah seventy times on a dead person, it will not be surprising if life is breathed into him again.”\r\n\r\nNinth: Imam Musa al-Kazim (‘a) is reported to have said, “A tremendous reward will be recorded for boys who recite Surah al-Falaq and Surah al-Nas three times and Surah al-Tawhid one hundred times every night. If this is unfeasible, it will be sufficiently acceptable to recite Surah al-Tawhid fifty times instead of one hundred. A boy who keeps on this manner continuously on a regular basis (or one keeps on reciting them on behalf of the boy), will be under divine protection up to his death.”\r\n\r\nTenth: Shaykh al-Kulayni has reported that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) said to al-Mufazzal: You may guard yourself from all people by bismillahi alrrahmani alrrahimi and by Surah al-Tawhid, which you may recite in front of you, to your backside, to your right side, to your left side, over you, and beneath you. If you are summoned by a tyrannical ruler, you may recite it three times the moment you look at him, grasping on your left hand. You may keep on so until you leave.\r\n\r\nExplanation: To grasp on the left hand may stand for keeping the fingers joined together, or the expression, as understood by some scholars, may stand for keeping on reciting the Surah repeatedly until one leaves that place.",
