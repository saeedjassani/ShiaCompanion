I sat in a corner to see the beauty of worship and listen to the recitation of Quran. Imam finished the Nafila of Shab and the Namaz-e-Shab and Vatr prayers. Then he (a.s.) recited some supplications like I have never heard. When he (a.s.) finished the prayers, I asked him: 'May I be sacrificed on you! What prayer you have recited?'\" \"It was Dua-e-Sanamay Quraish,\" he (a.s.) replied. Then he (a.s.) said, \"By the One in Whose control is the life of Muhammed and Ali, one who recites this dua would be rewarded so much as if he has participated in Jehad with the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) at the Battle of Uhud and Tabuk, and he has been martyred before the eyes of the Prophet (s.a.w.a.). He would also get the reward of 100 Hajjs and Umrahs performed with the Prophet (s.a.w.a.). And the reward of fasting for 1000 months. Also on the day of Qiyamat he would be raised with the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) and the Infallible Imams and the Almighty Allah would forgive all his sins, even if they had been equal to the stars of the sky, sand particles of the desert and leaves of all the trees. Also that person would be safe from the punishment of the grave. A door of Paradise would be opened for him.\"\r\n\r\nInsha Allah, all his supplications would be answered. O Ibne Abbas!

Curse the two idols of Quraish and their two magicians, their two rebellious people, their two accusers and their two daughters. Rebuke them, they have consumed Your sustenance and have denied Your obligations, both have discarded Your commands, have rejected Your revelation, have disobeyed Your Prophet, have destroyed Your religion, have distorted Your book, have made Your laws ineffective, have declared Your obligatory actions as incorrect, have disbelieved in Your signs, have oppressed Your friends, have favoured Your enemies, have spread corruption among Your people, have made Your world unstable and subject to loses. O Allah! Send Your curses on them and their helpers as they have ruined the house of Your prophet (saw), have dug the door of his house, broken the roof, have brought down the walls, have turned upside down the highly respected symbols (i.e. skies) to the lower status (i.e., ground). His explicit laws to the implicit jargon, have destroyed Your 'selected' inhabitants, have killed their supporters have put righteous to death, their children have been killed and confiscated His Prophet (saw)'s pulpit and denied rights of the successors of Prophet's knowledge to the divine pulpit, they themselves have desired for the prophet-hood, have ascribed a partner to their Lord, thus consider their sins to be absolute, and make their abode in 'saqar' forever, and You know what 'saqar does to its inhabitants!'\r\n\r\nIt leaves nothing, nor lets anything remain intact. O Allah, send Your chastisement on them; to the extent of the sins of every disobedient, and the covering of the truth, and all the pulpits which they have used, and the believers whom they have hurt and the disbelievers whom they have rewarded, And to the number of pious people whom they have troubled, and those who have driven out of their cities, and their support for the disbelievers, and their atrocities towards (Your appointed) Imam and have changed the obligatory laws, and have destroyed the traditions of the Holy Prophet, and whatever evils they have concealed, the blood which they shed, have changed the goodness and have altered the commands, have created disbelief, the lie for which they have cheated, the inheritance which they have plundered, and stopped the booties from them and have consumed the prohibited wealth, And that 'Khums' (the fifth part) which they considered as lawful for them, and those evils which they planted, and that cruelty which they regularly practised, that oppression, which they spread, those promises, which they dishonored, those covenant which they broke, those lawful matters which were reverted to be unlawful, and those forbidden acts which were made lawful, That hypocrisy which they have concealed in their hearts, and to the amount of treachery which they bore in their hearts, and that atrocity which targeted Masooma (s.a)'s stomach and inflicting lethal harm, and that 'pahlu' which they broke, and that door which they burnt-down, the Prophet's writing which they shredded and those 'haq' gatherings which they dispersed and those degraded ones which were honoured, and those honourables who were insulted, And (curse them) by the number of rights which they have usurped, and the orders of (Your) Imam which they opposed, impinge Your wrath on them to the extent of their atrocities. O Allah! Implicate Your curses on them to the extent of alterations they have introduced in Quran and the cover-ups in their lies, tempering with the divine wills, Lords deeds which were made redundant , and those promises which were disregarded, and those verdicts which were made void. Refusal of their allegiances, presentation of excuses, introduction of breach of trust, their acts of climbing on hills (for their lives) and those fixed rules which they turned other way round and all that defects which they possessed. Bestow Your curses on them. O Allah curse those two, secretly as well as openly, persistently, everlasting, non-stoppable one and innumerable times. Such a whipping that commences in the morning but does not ends at night. Such a beating should be on those tyrants, and their helpers, their associates, their friends and their fans ('Muslameen'), those who have attracted to them and those who acknowledge their deeds, those who present proof for them, and on those who standby their followers and those who follow their words, and those who approve their actions.\r\n\r\n(Then recite four times)\r\n\r\nO Allah! Send such a harsh chastisement upon them, that the dwellers of Hell start screaming for mercy, O Lord of the Universe! Accept this prayer from me."
