However, we notice that there is big recommendation on visiting the holy tomb of Imam ‘Ali (‘a) on occasions related to the Holy Prophet (s).\r\n\r\nTo answer, this is because of the firm connection between these two great individual and because of the perfect union between these two personalities. In view of that, to visit Imam ‘Ali (‘a) is as same as visiting the Holy Prophet (s). This fact has been mentioned in the Holy Qur’an Surah Ale Imran : Ayat 61.\r\n\r\nIn this holy verse, Almighty Allah has combined Imam ‘Ali (‘a) to the Holy Prophet (s) by referring to both of them by saying, ‘our selves’.\r\n\r\nBesides, this fact has been confirmed by many narrations and reports, such as the narration of Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Mashhadi who has reported the following event on the authority of Imam al-Sadiq (‘a):\r\n\r\nA Bedouin man came to the Holy Prophet (s) and said, “My house is far away from yours; and it happened that when I intended to visit and see you, I could not; therefore, I visit ‘Ali ibn Abi-Talib whose discourse and advices would entertain me. Whenever I left him, grief and sadness joined me over again because I could not see you.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s) answered, “He who visits ‘Ali has in fact visited me; he who loves ‘Ali has in fact loved me; he who antagonizes ‘Ali has in fact antagonized me. You may convey this to your people. Similarly, he who intends to visit ‘Ali has in fact visited me and I will reward him for so on the Resurrection Day. So will Archangel Gabriel and the righteous believers.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another authoritative narration, Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) is reported to have said, “Whenever you visit the district of al-Najaf, you may visit there the bones of Adam (‘a), the corpse of Noah, and the body of ‘Ali ibn Abi-Talib. So, you will visit the past forefathers, Muhammad the seal of the Prophets, and ‘Ali the best of the Prophets’ successors.”\r\n\r\nFinally, the previously mentioned sixth form of untimed ziyarah has contained statements that can act as support of this fact. These statements read as follows:\r\n\r\nYou may face the tomb of Imam ‘Ali (‘a) and say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا رَسُوْلَ اللهِ، اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا صَفْوَةَ اللهِ--In this respect too, Shaykh Jabir, referring to the dome of Imam ‘Ali’s holy shrine, has excellently composed poetic verses as commentary on the famous poem of al-Azri, saying:\r\n\r\n--فَاعْتَمِدْ لِلنَّبِيِّ اَعْظَمَ رَمْسٍ فِيْهِ لِلطُّهْرِ اَحْمَدٍ اَيَّ نَفْسٍ اَوْ تَرَى الْعَرْشَ فِيْهِ اَنْوَرَ شَمْسٍ فَتَوَاضَعْ فَثَمَّ دَارَةُ قُدْسٍ تَتَمَنَّى الْاَفْلَاكُ لَثْمَ ثَرَاهَا",

You will also see even the Divine Throne in the most radiant form. Then, be unassuming; for there lies a halo of holiness. Even highest stars wish to kiss its soil!"
