    "content": "Shaykh ‘Abbas al-Qummi, the author of this book, says: We do not need to mention the miraculous things that were shown from this sacred Paradisiacal place in the past and that have been taking place in every age. In Section Two of this book, within the recommended rites at the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, I have cited a discussion related to this topic.\r\n\r\nLet us close up this chapter with mentioning a couple of poetic verses composed by al-Jami, praising Imam al-Rida (‘a):\r\n\r\nPeace be upon the family of Taha and Yasin.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon the family of the Prophets.\r\n\r\nPeace be upon a garden in which resided,\r\n\r\nan Imam about whom kingship and religion are boasted.",
