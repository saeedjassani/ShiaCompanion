In the Name of Allah; the All-beneficent, the All-merciful; And if Allah should afflict you with harm, then there is none to remove it but He; and if He intends good to you there is none to repel His grace; He brings it to whom He pleases of His servants; and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. In the Name of Allah; the All-beneficent, the All-merciful; Allah brings about ease after difficulty. Only that which Allah will shall come to pass. There is no power save in Allah. Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector. And I entrust my affair to Allah. Surely, Allah sees the servants. There is no god but You. All glory be to You. Verily, I have been a wrongdoer. O Lord, surely I stand in need of whatever good You may send down to me. O my Lord, leave me not alone; and You are the best of inheritors."
