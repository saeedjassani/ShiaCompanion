    "content": "This prayer consists of two units in each of which Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Qadr are recited once each. After the recitation of these Surahs, the following supplicatory prayer is repeated fifteen times:\r\n\r\n--رَبِّ عَفْوَكَ عَفْوَكَ۔--The same supplicatory prayer is repeated, yet ten times, in the genuflection (ruku') of the prayer. Then, the prayer is accomplished just like the famous prayer of Ja’far.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the prayer for forgiveness is offered as same as this prayer for pardon, except that its supplicatory prayer should be as follows:\r\n\r\n--رَبِّ عَفْوَكَ اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ۔--This prayer is also useful for beseeching for expansive sustenance, Allah willing.",
