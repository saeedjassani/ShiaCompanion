You may then walk with tranquility and gravity. When you are at the gate of the holy shrine, you may ask permission of entrance by saying the aforesaid forms of asking permission of entrance (i.e. Isti’dhan), which have been cited in the first pages of this section of the book. You may then enter the holy shrine and visit the two Imams with the following form of ziyarah, which is considered the most authentic:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا وَلِيَّيِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا حُجَّتَيِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا نُورَيِ اللّٰهِ فِيْ ظُلُمَاتِ الْاَرْضِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمَا يَا مَنْ بَدَا لِلّٰهِ فِيْ شَأْنِكُمَا اَتَيْتُكُمَا زَاۤئِرًا عَارِفًا بِحَقِّكُمَا مُعَادِيًا لِاَعْدَاۤئِكُمَا مُوَالِيًا لِاَوْلِيَاۤئِكُمَا مُؤْمِنًا بِمَاۤ اٰمَنْتُمَا بِهِ كَافِرًا بِمَا كَفَرْتُمَا بِهِ مُحَقِّقًا لِمَا حَقَّقْتُمَا مُبْطِلًا لِمَاۤ اَبْطَلْتُمَا اَسْاَلُ اللّٰهَ رَبِّيْ وَ رَبَّكُمَاۤ اَنْ يَجْعَلَ حَظِّيْ مِنْ زِيَارَتِكُمَا الصَّلَاةَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِهِ وَ اَنْ يَرْزُقَنِيْ مُرَافَقَتَكُمَا فِي الْجِنَانِ مَعَ اٰبَاۤئِكُمَا الصَّالِحِيْنَ وَ اَسْاَلُهُ اَنْ يُعْتِقَ رَقَبَتِيْ مِنَ النَّارِ وَ يَرْزُقَنِيْ شَفَاعَتَكُمَا وَ مُصَاحَبَتَكُمَا، وَ يُعَرِّفَ بَيْنِيْ وَ بَيْنَكُمَا وَ لَا يَسْلُبَنِيْ حُبَّكُمَا وَ حُبَّ اٰبَاۤئِكُمَا الصَّالِحِيْنَ وَ اَنْ لَا يَجْعَلَهُ اٰخِرَ الْعَهْدِ مِنْ زِيَارَتِكُمَا وَ يَحْشُرَنِيْ مَعَكُمَا فِي الْجَنَّةِ بِرَحْمَتِهِ اَللّٰهُمَّ ارْزُقْنِيْ حُبَّهُمَا وَ تَوَفَّنِيْ عَلٰى مِلَّتِهِمَا اَللّٰهُمَّ الْعَنْ ظَالِمِيۤ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ حَقَّهُمْ وَ انْتَقِمْ مِنْهُمْ اَللّٰهُمَّ الْعَنِ الْاَوَّلِيْنَ مِنْهُمْ وَ الْاٰخِرِيْنَ وَ ضَاعِفْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَذَابَ وَ ابْلُغْ بِهِمْ وَ بِاَشْيَاعِهِمْ وَ مُحِبِّيْهِمْ وَ مُتَّبِعِيْهِمْ اَسْفَلَ دَرْكٍ مِنَ الْجَحِيْمِ اِنَّكَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَيْ‏ءٍ قَدِيْرٌ اَللّٰهُمَّ عَجِّلْ فَرَجَ وَلِيِّكَ وَ ابْنَ وَلِيِّكَ وَ اجْعَلْ فَرَجَنَا مَعَ فَرَجِهِمْ [فَرَجِهِ‏] يَاۤ اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔--You may then pray for yourself and your parents painstakingly. You may choose any supplication to say.\r\n\r\nIf you can reach their tombs, you may offer a two-unit prayer there. If you can only reach the mosque, you may offer the prayer there and pray Almighty Allah for anything you wish, for He is nigh and responding.\r\n\r\nThis mosque is adjacent to the house of the two Imams, peace of Allah be upon them, where they used to perform the prayers.\r\n\r\nLITTLE DIFFERENCE\r\n\r\nThe aforesaid form of ziyarah has been cited according to the book of Kamil al-Ziyarah. However, Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Mashhadi, Shaykh al-Mufid, and al-Shahid, in their books on forms of ziyarah, have recorded it with little difference. After the phrase:\r\n\r\n--وَيَحْشُرَنِيْ مَعَاكُمَا فِي الْجَنَّةِ بِرَحْمَتِةِ--They added the following: You may then approach towards the two tombs, throw yourself on them, kiss them, and place your two cheeks on them. When you raise your head, you may say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ ارْزُقْنِىْ حُبَّهُمْ وَ تَوَفَّنِىْ عَلٰى مِلَّتِهِمْ۔۔۔--Up to the end of the aforesaid form of ziyarah.\r\n\r\nThey then added: You may now offer four units of prayer next to the side of the Imam’s head. Then, you may offer any other prayers... etc.",

Peace be upon both of you, O Arguments of Allah (against His created beings). Peace be upon both of you, O Light of Allah in the darkness of the earth. Peace be upon both of you, O they about whom Allah has decided. I have come to you visiting (your tombs), recognizing your right, showing enmity towards your enemies, declaring loyalty to your loyalists, believing in that which you both believed in, disbelieving in all that which you both disbelieved in, deeming right all that which you deemed right, and deeming wrong all that which you deemed wrong. I thus beseech Allah, my and your Lord, to decide that my rewards for my visit to you both to be His sending blessings upon Muhammad and his Household and to grant me the favor of accompanying you both in the gardens of Paradise with your righteous fathers. I also beseech Him to save me from Hellfire, to grant me your intercession and your company, to introduce me to you, not to take out from my heart love for you both and for your righteous fathers at all, not to decide this time of my visit to you as the last, and to include me with your group in Paradise, out of His mercy. O Allah, (please do) grant me love for them and make me die following their faith. O Allah, curse and punish those who usurped the right of the Household of Muhammad wrongfully. O Allah, curse the past and the coming generations of those people, apply to them many folds of torture, and send them, their fans, their adherents, and the followers to the deepest area of Hellfire. Verily, You have power over all things. O Allah, (please do) hasten the Relief of Your representative and the son of Your representative and cause our relief to accompany his relief, O most merciful of all those who show mercy.\r\n\r\nYou may then pray for yourself and your parents painstakingly. You may choose any supplication to say.\r\n\r\nIf you can reach their tombs, you may offer a twounit prayer there.
