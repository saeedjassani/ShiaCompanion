I asked about the reason, and he answered: Had this question not been part of the religion that we are ordered to convey and transmit to its people, I would have preferred keeping silence. However, this is the religion. You may write down:",

O Allah, as You have made him the source of light from which the believers derive light, and so he conveyed the good tidings of Your abundant reward, warned against Your painful punishment, notified against Your prowess, reminded of Your sings, rendered legal that which You have deemed legal, rendered illegal that which You have deemed illegal, explained Your laws and the duties towards You, encouraged on servitude to You, enjoined obedience to You, and forbade disobedience to You, so also (please) bless him with the most favorite blessings that You have ever bestowed upon any of Your intimate servants and descendants of Your Prophets. O God of the Worlds!"
