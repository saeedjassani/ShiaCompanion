If you intend to bid farewell to the visited holy person and leave, you may say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا اَهْلَ بَيْتِ النُّبُوَّةِ وَ مَعْدِنَ الرِّسَالَةِ سَلَامَ مُوَدِّعٍ لَا سَئِمٍ وَ لَا قَالٍ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ۔--Shaykh al-Mufid has also mentioned these words, but he added: After the statement, you may say the following words:\r\n\r\n--يَا وَلِيَّ اللّٰهِ اِنَّ بَيْنِيْ وَ بَيْنَ اللّٰهِ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ ذُنُوْبًا لَا يَأْتِيْ عَلَيْهَاۤ اِلَّا رِضَاكَ فَبِحَقِّ مَنِ ائْتَمَنَكَ عَلٰى سِرِّهِ وَ اسْتَرْعَاكَ اَمْرَ خَلْقِهِ وَ قَرَنَ طَاعَتَكَ بِطَاعَتِهِ وَ مُوَالَاتَكَ بِمُوَالَاتِهِ تَوَلَّ صَلَاحَ حَالِى مَعَ اللّٰهِ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ وَ اجْعَلْ حَظِّيْ مِنْ زِيَارَتِكَ تَخْلِيْطِيْ بِخَالِصِيْ زُوَّارِكَ الَّذِيْنَ تَسْاَلُ اللّٰهَ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ فِي عِتْقِ رِقَابِهِمْ وَ تَرْغَبُ اِلَيْهِ فِيْ حُسْنِ ثَوَابِهِمْ وَ هَاۤ اَنَا الْيَوْمَ بِقَبْرِكَ لَاۤئِذٌ وَ بِحُسْنِ دِفَاعِكَ عَنِّيْ عَاۤئِذٌ فَتَلَافَنِيْ يَا مَوْلَايَ وَ اَدْرِكْنِيْ وَ اَسْاَلِ اللّٰهَ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ فِيۤ اَمْرِيْ فَاِنَّ لَكَ عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ مَقَامًا كَرِيْمًا وَ جَاهًا عَظِيْمًا صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ وَ سَلَّمَ تَسْلِيْمًا۔--A visitor of any of the holy shrines, or any suppliant wherever he may be and whatever prayer he may say, is highly recommended to begin with praying Almighty Allah for the good of Imam al-Mahdi, Almighty Allah’s argument in this age and the patron of the divine mission. Although this issue is of great importance and brings about many significant advantages, it seems unsuitable to refer to this importance or mention these advantages in this place.\r\n\r\nHowever, Shaykh al-Nuri, in Chapter Ten of his book of al-Najm al-Thaqib, has discussed this issue in details and mentioned some supplications in this regard. It is thus recommended to refer to this chapter. The briefest supplication in this connection has been previously cited in this book within the recommended acts at the twenty-third night of Ramazan. It is the following supplication:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ كُنْ لِوَلِيِّكَ الْحُجَّةِ بْنِ الْحَسَنِ صَلَوَاتُكَ عَلَيْهِ وَعَلٰى اٰبَاۤئِه فِىْ هٰذِهِ السَّاعَةِ وَ فِىْ كُلِّ سَاعَةٍ وَلِيًّا وَّ حَافِظًا وَّ قَاۤئِدًا وَّ نَاصِرًا وَّ دَلِيْلًا وَّ عَيْنًا حَتّٰى تُسْكِنَهُ اَرْضَكَ طَوْعًا وَتُمَتِّعَهُ فِيْهَا طَوِيْلًا۔--Within the etiquettes of visiting Imam al-Husayn (‘a), I have mentioned another supplication that can be said at all of the holy shrines. The supplication begins with the following statement:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ قَدْ تَرَيٰ مَكَانِيْ وَتَسْمَعُ كَلَامِيْ۔۔۔",

And if my sins have impeded from raising my voice to You, impeded form forgiving any of my sins, or overlooking any of my destructive fault, then, here I am seeking shelter with the nobleness of Your Face and the dignity of Your majesty; and (here I am) begging You and seeking nearness to You through the most beloved of Your creatures to You, the most honorable with You, the nearest to You, the most obedient to You, and the owners of the greatest standing and position with You; namely, Muhammad and his immaculate descendants, the Imams, the guide and well-guided, the obedience to whom has been imposed by You on Your creatures, the love for whom has been ordered by You, and whom You have made the men in authority after Your Messenger, Allah's blessings be upon him and his Household. O He Who humiliates every obstinate tyrant! O He Who grants dignity to the faithful believers! I have exerted all my efforts; so, (please) release me at this very moment and grant me mercy from You that You may endow me, O most merciful of all those who show mercy.\r\n\r\nYou may now kiss the holy tomb, put your two cheeks on it, and say the following words:\r\n\r\nO Allah, this is verily a place wherein one who misses Your mercy must never expect to find it elsewhere. None can be more miserable that one who visits this place, bearing hope, but leaves it with disappointment. O Allah, I do seek Your protection against evil return, hopeless retirement, and hard interrogation when I am called to account. It is too far from You, O my Lord, that after You matched the obedience to Your (visited) representative to the obedience to You, the loyalty to him to the loyalty to You, and the disobedience to him to the disobedience to You, You may then shock with despair one who has visited him and who has undergone remoteness from homeland to come to his grave! By Your Honor, O my Lord, I swear; my conscience can never even think of so, because all hearts always have excellent ideas about You.\r\n\r\nYou may now offer the prayer of ziyarah. If you intend to bid farewell to the visited holy person and leave, you may say the following words:\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you all, O household of prophethood and essence of the (divine) Message. I offer you the salutation of one who has to bid farewell to you although he is neither bored with you nor tired of you. Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you.\r\n\r\nShaykh alMufid has also mentioned these words, but he added:\r\n\r\nAfter the statement,\r\n\r\nbecause all hearts always have excellent ideas about You.\r\n\r\nyou may say the following words:\r\n\r\nO representative of Allah, there are sins that I have committed against Allah and nothing can mend them except winning your pleasure. So, I ask you in the name of Him Who has entrusted you with His secret, Who has commended you the affairs of His creation, and Who has matched the obedience to you to the obedience to Him and the loyalty to you to the loyalty to Him, to be in charge of setting aright my relationship with Allah the Almighty and All-majestic, to decide my share of my visit to you to be that you link me to the elite visitors of you whom you ask Allah the Almighty and All-majestic to set free (from punishment) and whom you beg Him to grant excellent rewards. Here I am now seeking refuge in your tomb and seeking the protection of your excellent defense of me. So, O my master, succor me, help me, and ask Allah the Almighty and All-majestic about my condition. Verily, you enjoy an honorable standing with Allah as well as a great esteem. May Allah bless you and endue you with thorough benediction.\r\n\r\nA visitor of any of the holy shrines, or any suppliant wherever he may be and whatever prayer he may say, is highly recommended to begin with praying Almighty Allah for the good of Imam alMahdi, Almighty Allah’s argument in this age and the patron of the divine mission.
