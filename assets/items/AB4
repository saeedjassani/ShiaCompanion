    "content": "On the last day of Dhu’l-Qa’dah 220 AH, Imam Muhammad ibn Ali al-Yaqi al-Jawad(a.s.) was martyred. He was poisoned by Al-Mu’tasim Bi’llah, the ‘Abbasid ruler. That was only two years and a half after the death of al-Ma’mun, the ‘Abbasid ruler. The Imam (a.s.) himself had predicted so when he said, “Relief shall come thirty months after the death of al-Ma’mun.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, this statement reveals the scope of torture and pain that were suffered by the Imam (a.s.) in his life with al-Ma’mun. Hence, the Imam (a.s.) regarded his passing away as relief. Similarly, his father, Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Rida(a.s.), suffered the same pains and hardships when he was appointed as the crown prince. Whenever he returned from the mosque on Fridays, Imam al-Rida(a.s.) used to raise his hands to the sky, sweaty and dust-covered, and supplicate to Almighty Allah, saying, “My God, if my death is my relief, then please do hasten the hour of my death.” He, furthermore, was always depressed and miserable until he departed life.\r\n\r\nImam Muhammad ibn Ali al-Yaqi(a.s.) lived for twenty-five years and a few months only. His holy tomb is directly behind the holy tomb of his grandfather, Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.), in the city of al-Kazimiyyah, Baghdad.",
