Hence, a visitor of this Imam (‘a) is advised not to miss the reward of this form of invocation of blessings, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُوْسَى بْنِ جَعْفَرٍ وَصِيِّ الْاَبْرَارِ وَ اِمَامِ الْاَخْيَارِ وَ عَيْبَةِ الْاَنْوَارِ وَ وَارِثِ السَّكِيْنَةِ وَ الْوَقَارِ وَ الْحِكَمِ وَ الْاٰثَارِ الَّذِيْ كَانَ يُحْيِيْ اللَّيْلَ بِالسَّهَرِ اِلَى السَّحَرِ بِمُوَاصَلَةِ الْاِسْتِغْفَارِ حَلِيْفِ السَّجْدَةِ الطَّوِيْلَةِ وَ الدُّمُوْعِ الْغَزِيْرَةِ وَ الْمُنَاجَاةِ الْكَثِيْرَةِ وَ الضَّرَاعَاتِ الْمُتَّصِلَةِ وَ مَقَرِّ النُّهٰى وَ الْعَدْلِ وَ الْخَيْرِ وَ الْفَضْلِ وَ النَّدٰى وَ الْبَذْلِ وَ مَأْلَفِ الْبَلْوٰى وَ الصَّبْرِ وَ الْمُضْطَهَدِ بِالظُّلْمِ وَ الْمَقْبُوْرِ بِالْجَوْرِ وَ الْمُعَذَّبِ فِيْ قَعْرِ السُّجُوْنِ وَ ظُلَمِ الْمَطَامِيْرِ ذِي السَّاقِ الْمَرْضُوْضِ بِحَلَقِ الْقُيُوْدِ وَ الْجَنَازَةِ الْمُنَادٰى عَلَيْهَا بِذُلِّ الْاِسْتِخْفَافِ وَ الْوَارِدِ عَلٰى جَدِّهِ الْمُصْطَفٰى وَ اَبِيْهِ الْمُرْتَضٰى وَ اُمِّهِ سَيِّدَةِ النِّسَاۤءِ، بِاِرْثٍ مَغْصُوْبٍ وَ وَلَاۤءٍ مَسْلُوْبٍ وَ اَمْرٍ مَغْلُوْبٍ وَ دَمٍ مَطْلُوْبٍ وَ سَمٍّ مَشْرُوْبٍ اَللّٰهُمَّ وَ كَمَا صَبَرَ عَلٰى غَلِيْظِ الْمِحَنِ وَ تَجَرَّعَ غُصَصَ الْكُرَبِ وَ اسْتَسْلَمَ لِرِضَاكَ وَ اَخْلَصَ الطَّاعَةَ لَكَ وَ مَحَضَ الْخُشُوْعَ وَ اسْتَشْعَرَ الْخُضُوْعَ وَ عَادَى الْبِدْعَةَ وَ اَهْلَهَا وَ لَمْ يَلْحَقْهُ فِيْ شَيْ‏ءٍ مِنْ اَوَامِرِكَ وَ نَوَاهِيْكَ لَوْمَةُ لَاۤئِمٍ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ صَلَاةً نَامِيَةً مُنِيْفَةً زَاكِيَةً تُوْجِبُ لَهُ بِهَا شَفَاعَةَ اُمَمٍ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ وَ قُرُوْنٍ مِنْ بَرَايَاكَ وَ بَلِّغْهُ عَنَّا تَحِيَّةً وَ سَلَامًا وَ اٰتِنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ فِيْ مُوَالَاتِهِ فَضْلًا وَ اِحْسَانًا وَ مَغْفِرَةً وَ رِضْوَانًا اِنَّكَ ذُوْ الْفَضْلِ الْعَمِيْمِ وَ التَّجَاوُزِ الْعَظِيْمِ بِرَحْمَتِكَ يَاۤ اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔",

Hence, a visitor of this Imam (‘a) is advised not to miss the reward of this form of invocation of blessings, which is as follows:\r\n\r\nO Allah, (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and his Household and send blessings upon Müsâ the son of Ja'far, the successor of the righteous ones, the leader of the excellent ones, the case of illuminations, and the inheritor of tranquility, solemnity, wisdoms, and traditions, who used to spend nights sleeplessly up to the early dawn with continuous implorations for forgiveness. He was inseparable associate of lengthy prostrations, heavy tears, very much confidential talks, and incessant implorations. He was the center of understanding, justice, goodness, virtue, generosity, and liberality. He was also accustomed to ordeals and endurance and he was persecuted wrongfully, entombed unjustly, and tortured in the bottom of jails and darkness of cells. He is the one whose leg was bruised by the rings of chains and whose funeral was called with calls of humility of belittling. He is the one who joined his grandfather the Chosen Prophet, his father the Well-pleased leader, and his mother the doyenne of women with usurped inheritance, robbed loyalty, overpowered state, unavenged blood, and poisoned drink. O Allah, just as he suffered hard-hitting ordeals tolerantly, swallowed chokes of agonies, surrendered to Your pleasure, obeyed You sincerely, adopted reverence for You, adapted himself with submission to You, stood against heresies and their bearers, and did not care for the blame of any blamer in the course of following Your orders and refraining from Your prohibitions; so, (please) bless him with ever-increasing, towering, and purifying blessings due to which You endue him with the intercession of nations from Your creatures and centuries of Your beings. And convey to him greetings and salutation from us, give us from You on account of our loyalty to him favors, bounty, forgiveness, and pleasure. Verily, You are the Lord of prevalent favor and great exoneration, in the name of Your mercy; O most merciful of all those who show mercy."
