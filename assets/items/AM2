Visiting the tombs of these personalities does not require much effort, because they are all situated in near places in Baghdad; therefore, they are not far away for the visitors. However, even if these graves were scattering in remote places, they would be worthy of being visited by covering long distances and suffering the troubles of travel, because great reward and abundant prize are gained from visiting these graves.\r\n\r\nThe Four Emissaries excelled all the companions and elite friends of the Holy Imams (‘a) in rank and excellence. They thus won the Imam’s representation, emissary, and mediation between him and the subjects for seventy years. They also showed many extraordinary manners and innumerable miracles. Moreover, some scholars are reported to have imputed Divinely-granted infallibility (i.e. ‘ismah) to these personalities.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that these personalities are still mediators between the Imam (‘a) and the subjects after their death; it is therefore necessary to make them the means and way to convey to the Imam, in a written form, the needs and ordeals from which his subjects suffer. Details of these matters have been discussed in relevant topics.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, no pen can contain the great merits and supreme statuses of these personalities. We thus hope that the previous discussion gives the visitors the desire to visit their tombs.",
