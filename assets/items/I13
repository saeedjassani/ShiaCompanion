Keep on reciting Ayah al-Kursi after every obligatory prayer, because not everyone keeps on reciting it save a prophet, a veracious person, or a martyr.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is reported to have said, “Whoever recites Ayah al-Kursi after every prayer, nothing will prevent him from entering Paradise except death.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another tradition, “Whoever recites Ayah al-Kursi after obligatory prayers will have his prayers accepted, will be in the security of Allah, and will be saved by Almighty Allah from misfortunes and sinning.”",
