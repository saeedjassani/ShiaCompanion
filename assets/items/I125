    "content": "When the burier finishes and intends to come out of the grave, he should come out from the legsâ€™ side. He should then cover the grave with dust raising it four fingers higher than the level of the ground. He must not put in the grave any dust that does not belong to the hole itself. At the side of the head, he should put a brick or a tablet. Then, he should pour water on the grave beginning with the side of the head. He then turn to the four sides of the grave and return to the side of the head. If any amount of water remains, he may pour it on the middle of the grave.",
