    "content": "Sayyid Muhammad the son of Imam ‘Ali al-Hadi has a famous shrine near a village called Balad. This sayyid is well-known for virtue and sublimity as well as extraordinary, miraculous signs. All people always have the honor of visiting his shrine, making vows, presenting numerous contributions, and asking their needs to be granted by Almighty Allah. The Arab dwellers of that village venerate and hold him in the highest regard.\r\n\r\nIt is said that miraculous matters, which are too many to be mentioned in this book, were seen from that shrine. A sufficient virtue and honor of this sayyid is that he was qualified for Imamate and he was the eldest son of Imam al-Hadi (‘a). Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari (‘a), expressing sadness for the departure of this sayyid, tore his shirt.\r\n\r\nOur mentor, the trusty Shaykh al-Nuri, may Allah illumine his grave, had full faith in the pilgrimage to the shrine of Sayyid Muhammad; he therefore had many attempts to build up his shrine, writing down the following inscription on the holy tomb: “This is the tomb of the sublime Sayyid Abu-Ja’far Muhammad the son of Imam Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali al-Hadi, peace be upon him, a person of a great esteem and sublime regard.”\r\n\r\nHis contemporary Shi’ah used to claim that Sayyid Muhammad would be the next Imam after his father, but when Sayyid Muhammad passed away, his father named his brother Abu-Muhammad al-Zaki (al-’Askari) as the next Imam. Commenting on this nomination, the Imam (‘a) said to his son, “Renew thanks for Almighty Allah, because He has decided a new decree about you.”\r\n\r\nSayyid Muhammad’s father left him in al-Madinah as child, but the son joined his father in Samarra’ while he was ailed. When he tried to return to Hijaz, his ailment intensified, causing him to die in that village of Balad, about 40 kilometers away from Samarra’. When he died, Imam al-’Askari (‘a) tore his shirt as expression of deep sadness. When he was blamed for that, the Imam (‘a) said, “Prophet Moses tore his shirt when his brother, Prophet Aaron, died.”\r\n\r\nSayyid Muhammad passed away in approximately AH 252.",
