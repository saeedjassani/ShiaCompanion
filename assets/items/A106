The Holy Prophet (S) said that whoever recites this Surah before going to sleep at night will be saved from the torments of the grave. If this Surah is recited in faraa’idh prayers, the reciter will get the reward of a hundred martyrs.

Recitation of this Surah is a cure from headaches. Another way of reciting salaat al-Wahshat (apart from the commonly known way) is to recite Ayahul Kursi once and Surah al-Ikhlas twice after the al-Hamd of the first rak’aat and then recite Surah at-Takaathur ten times after the al-Hamd of the second rak’aat.\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ--اَلْهٰٮكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُۙ‏(1)--حَتّٰى زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَؕ‏(2)--كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُوْنَۙ‏(3)--ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُوْنَؕ‏(4)--كَلَّا لَوْ تَعْلَمُوْنَ عِلْمَ الْيَقِيْنِؕ‏(5)--لَتَرَوُنَّ الْجَحِيْمَۙ‏(6)--ثُمَّ لَتَرَوُنَّهَا عَيْنَ الْيَقِيْنِۙ‏(7)--ثُمَّ لَتُسْئَلُنَّ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَنِ النَّعِيْمِ‏(8)",
