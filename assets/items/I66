    "content": "In conclusion, visiting the graves of faithful believers brings about an abundant reward in addition to great advantages and outcomes. It gives lessons in religiousness, draws attentions to the reality of our worldly lives, encourages asceticism and abstinence from worldly pleasures, and arouses the desire for the Hereafter.\r\n\r\nVisiting the graves becomes highly recommended for those who are highly delighted or extremely distressed.\r\n\r\nA true reasonable is he who learns lessons from graves, stripping himself of the sweetness of this worldly life and changing its sweet taste into bitterness, he who ponders over the inevitable extinction of this worldly life and the ceaseless changeability of its manners, and he who always remembers that very soon, he will be just like these inhabitants of graves, will fail to do any further charitable deed, and will be lesson for others.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that Almighty Allah revealed to Prophet Jesus (‘a), saying:\r\n\r\n--يَا عِيْسٰى هَبْ لِيْ مِنْ عَيْنِكَ الدُّمُوْعَ وَ مِنْ قَلْبِكَ الْخُشُوْعَ وَ اكْحُلْ عَيْنَيْكَ بِمِيْلِ الْحُزْنِ اِذَا ضَحِكَ الْبَطَّالُوْنَ وَ قُمْ عَلٰى قُبُوْرِ الْاَمْوَاتِ فَنَادِهِمْ بِالصَّوْتِ الرَّفِيْعِ لَعَلَّكَ تَأْخُذُ مَوْعِظَتَكَ مِنْهُمْ وَ قُلْ اِنِّيْ لَاحِقٌ بِهِمْ فِي اللَّاحِقِيْنَ--AFTERWORD\r\n\r\nThe last statement of this blessed book was recorded at Sunday night, the tenth of the sacred month of Dhu’l-Qa’dah, AH 1344. It is the birth night of Imam Abu’l-Hasan al-Rida, peace be upon him. On this day, I have just received a letter informing me about the passing away of my mother. I therefore please my brethren-in-faith who will make use of the supplications and forms of ziyarah mentioned in this book to pray Almighty Allah to have mercy on and forgive my mother, my father, and me in this worldly life and after death.\r\n\r\nAll praise be to Allah initially and finally.\r\n\r\nMay Allah send blessings upon Muhammad and his Immaculate Household.\r\n\r\n‘Abbas al-Qummi",
