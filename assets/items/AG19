He preferred his brother to himself and sacrificed himself for him until his two hands were severed. So, Almighty Allah shall give him as compensation two wings to fly with the angels in Paradise in the same way as He shall do to Ja’far ibn Abi-Talib. Verily, al-’Abbas shall enjoy such a supreme position with Almighty Allah due to which all martyrs will hope to have its like on the Resurrection Day.”\r\n\r\nIt has been also reported that al-’Abbas, peace be upon him, was thirty-four years old when he was martyred. His mother, Ummu’l-Banin, used to go out to the al-Baqi’ Cemetery to elegize, weep, and mourn for al-’Abbas and his brothers. Whoever passed be her would not be able to stop weeping for her mournful style.\r\n\r\nActually, it is not strange to find a loyalist (to the Ahl al-Bayt) weeping for al-’Abbas when he listened to the mournful words of Lady Ummu’l-Banin, because even Marwan ibn al-Hakam, the bitterest enemy of the Ahl al-Bayt, could not help weeping when he heard the mournful words of this lady.\r\n\r\nElegizing al-’Abbas and her other sons, Ummu’l-Banin composed the following poetic verses:\r\n\r\n--يَا مَنْ رَاَى الْعَبَّاسَ كَرَّ عَلَى جَمَاهِيْرِ النَّقَدِ وَ وَرَاهُ مِنْ اَبْنَاۤءِ حَيْدَرَ كُلُّ لَيْثٍ ذِيْ لَبَدٍ اُنْبِئْتُ اَنَّ ابْنِيْ اُصِيْبَ بِرَأْسِهِ مَقْطُوْعَ يَدٍ وَيْلِيْ عَلٰى شِبْلِيْ اَمَالَ بِرَأْسِهِ ضَرْبُ الْعَمَدِ لَوْ كَانَ سَيْفُكَ فِيْ يَدَيْكَ لَمَا دَنَا مِنْهُ اَحَدٌ--She also composed the following verses:\r\n\r\n--لَا تَدْعُوَنِّيْ وَيْكِ اُمَّ الْبَنِيْنَ تُذَكِّرِيْنِيْ بِلُيُوْثِ الْعَرِيْنِ كَانَتْ بَنُوْنَ لِيْ اُدْعٰى بِهِمْ وَ الْيَوْمَ اَصْبَحْتُ وَ لَا مِنْ بَنِيْنَ اَرْبَعَةٌ مِثْلُ نُسُوْرِ الرُّبٰى قَدْ وَاصَلُوْا الْمَوْتَ بِقَطْعِ الْوَتِيْنِ تَنَازَعَ الْخِرْصَانُ اَشْلَاۤءَهُمْ فَكُلُّهُمْ اَمْسٰى صَرِيْعًا طَعِيًنَ يَا لَيْتَ شِعْرِيۤ اَ كَمَاۤ اَخْبَرُوْا بِاَنَّ عَبَّاسًا قَطِيْعُ الْيَمِيْنِ",

I have been told that my son was stricken on the head and had his hand cut! Woe me for my young lion! Did the stroke of the iron post bow his head? Had his sword been in his hand, none could have ever approached him.\r\n\r\nShe also composed the following verses:\r\n\r\nDo not call me Ummu'l-Banin (Mother of the sons). You will remind me of the lions of the lair. I had sons by whom I was called, but today, I have no single son! They were four; like eagles on heights. They faced dea th by ha ving their aorta cut off The ravenous lances crowded on their bodies. So, all of them were pierced and stabbed. Great is my distress! Is it true what they have told that 'Abbas,s right hand was severed?"
