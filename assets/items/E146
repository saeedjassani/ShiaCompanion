    "content": "Too many are the supplications that have been reported from the Holy Prophet and the Holy Imams, peace be upon them, to be said at sunrise and sunset. Besides, verses from the Holy Qur’an and traditions of the Infallibles, peace be upon them, have urged on and awakened desires for the persistence on saying such supplications at these two times of the day. However, let us mention a few number of these authenticated supplications:\r\n\r\nFirst: Master Hadithists have narrated, through authenticated chain of authority (sanad), that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said: It is incumbent upon each and every Muslim to repeat the following supplicatory prayer ten times before sunrise and ten times before sunset:\r\n\r\n--لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَ لَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِيْ وَ يُمِيْتُ وَ يُمِيْتُ وَ يُحْيِيْ وَ هُوَ حَيٌّ لَا يَمُوْتُ بِيَدِهِ الْخَيْرُ وَ هُوَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَيْ‏ءٍ قَدِيْرٌ ۔--According to some narrations, this supplication should be made up if it is missed because it is obligatory.\r\n\r\nSecond: Through trustworthy chains of authority too, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said: Before sunrise and sunset, repeat ten times the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَعُوْذُ بِاللّٰهِ السَّمِيْعِ الْعَلِيْمِ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِيْنِ وَ اَعُوْذُ بِاللّٰهِ اَنْ يَحْضُرُوْنِ اِنَّ اللهَ هُوَ السَّمِيْعُ الْعَلِيْمُ۔--Third: Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: Nothing should divert you from saying the following supplicatory prayer three times each morning and evening:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ مُقَلِّبَ الْقُلُوْبِ وَ الْاَبْصَارِ ثَبِّتْ قَلْبِيْ عَلٰى دِيْنِكَ وَ لَا تُزِغْ قَلْبِيْ بَعْدَ اِذْ هَدَيْتَنِيْ وَ هَبْ لِي مِنْ لَّدُنْكَ رَحْمَةً اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ الْوَهَّابُ وَ اَجِرْنِي مِنَ النَّارِ بِرَحْمَتِكَ اَللّٰهُمَّ امْدُدْ لِي فِي عُمْرِيْ وَ اَوْسِعْ عَلَيَّ فِي رِزْقِيْ وَ انْشُرْ عَلَيَّ رَحْمَتَكَ وَ اِنْ كُنْتُ عِنْدَكَ فِيْ اُمِّ الْكِتَابِ شَقِيًّا فَاجْعَلْنِيْ سَعِيْدًا فَاِنَّكَ تَمْحُوْ مَا تَشَاۤءُ وَ تُثْبِتُ وَ عِنْدَكَ اُمُّ الْكِتَابِ۔--Fourth: Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have instructed to say the following supplicatory prayer each morning and evening:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِيْ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَاۤءُ وَ لَا يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَاۤءُ غَيْرُهُ اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ كَمَا يُحِبُّ اللهُ اَنْ يُّحْمَدَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ كَمَا هُوَ اَهْلُهُ اَللّٰهُمَّ اَدْخِلْنِيْ فِي كُلِّ خَيْرٍ اَدْخَلْتَ فِيْهِ مُحَمَّدًا وَ اٰلَ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَخْرِجْنِيْ مِنْ كُلِّ شَرٍّ اَخْرَجْتَ مِنْهُ مُحَمَّدًا وَ اٰلَ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ--Fifth: Repeat the following litany ten times each morning and evening:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ وَ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَ اللهُ اَكْبَرُ ۔--Dua al-Ashraat, which will be later on cited in this book, is one of the supplications to be advisably said each morning and evening.",

To him is the kingdom and to Him is all praise. He gives life and causes to die and causes to die and gives life while He is ever-living and never dies. In His hand is the good and He has power over all things. \r\n\r\nAccording to some narrations, this supplication should be made up if it is missed because it is obligatory.\r\n\r\nSecond: Through trustworthy chains of authority too, Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) is reported to have said: Before sunrise and sunset, repeat ten times the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nI seek the protection of Allah, the All-hearing and All-knowing, against the evil suggestions of the devils and I seek Allah’s protection lest they be present with me. Verily, Allah is the All-hearing, the All-knowing. \r\n\r\nThird: Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) is also reported to have said: Nothing should divert you from saying the following supplicatory prayer three times each morning and evening:\r\n\r\nO Allah Who causes the changes of hearts and sights, (please) make firm my heart on the course of Your religion, cause not my heart to stray off after You have guided me, and bestow upon me mercy from Your Presence. Surely, You are the All-bestower. And save me from Hellfire out of Your mercy. O Allah, (please) extend my lifetime, expand my sustenance, cover me with Your mercy, and if I am listed in the Mother of the Book with the unhappy ones, please include me with the happy ones, for, surely, You efface what You will, and establish what You will, and with You is the Mother of the Book. \r\n\r\nFourth: Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) is also reported to have instructed to say the following supplicatory prayer each morning and evening:\r\n\r\nAll praise be to Allah Who does whatever He wills and none else can ever do whatever one wills. All praise be to Allah as much as Allah desires to be praised. All praise be to Allah as much as He is worthy of praising. O Allah, include me with each (item of) goodness with which You have included Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, and take me out of each (item of) evil from which You have taken out Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad. May Allah bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad. \r\n\r\nFifth: Repeat the following litany ten times each morning and evening:\r\n\r\nAll glory be to Allah, all praise be to Allah, there is no god save Allah, and Allah is the Greatest. \r\n\r\nDua al-Ashraat, which will be later on cited in this book, is one of the supplications to be advisably said each morning and evening."
