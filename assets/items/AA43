In the genuflection (ruku') of the prayer (ruku’) and prostration (sujud), the following doxology (zikr) may be repeated ten times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ وَلَآ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَاللهُ اَكْبَرُ۔--After each couple of units, one may say the Tashahhud and Taslim statements.
