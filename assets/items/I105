May Allah have mercy upon him.\r\n\r\nJust like all of his reports, I have reported this type of Istikharah from him according to the following chain of authority: A number of our mentors have reported on the authority of the grand and virtuous Shaykh Jamal al-Din ibn al-Mutahhar on the authority of his father, may Allah be pleased with both of them, on the authority of Sayyid Razi al-Din on the authority of the Patron of the Matter; Imam al-Mahdi (‘a) who said:\r\n\r\nSurah al-Fatihah is repeated ten times, or at least three times, or at the least one time. Then Surah al-Qadr is repeated ten times and then this supplicatory prayer is repeated three times:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنّىْۤ اَسْتَخِيْرُكَ لِعِلْمِكَ بِعَاقِبَةِ الْاُمُوْرِ وَ اَسْتَشِيْرُكَ لِحُسْنِ ظَنِّىْ بِكَ فِى الْمَاْمُوْلِ وَالْمَحْذُوْرِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنْ كَانَ الْاَمْرُ الْفُلَانِىْ مِمَّا قَدْنِيْطَتْ بِالْبَرَكَةِ اَعْجَازُهُ وَ بَوَادِيْهِ وَ حُفَّتْ بِالْكَرَامَةِ اَيَّامُهُ وَ لَيَالِيْهِ فَخِرْلِىْ اَللّٰهُمَّ فِيْهِ خِيَرَةً تَرُدُّ شُمُوْسَهُ ذَلُوْلًا وَ تَقْعَضُ اَيَّامَهُ سُرُوْرًا اَللّٰهُمَّ اِمَّا اَمْرٌ فَائْتَمِرْ وَ اِمَّا نَهْىٌ فَاَنْتَهِىْ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّىْۤ اَسْتَخِيْرُكَ بِرَحْمَتِكَ خِيَرَةً فِىْ عَافِيَةٍ--Then, a portion of the rosary is held with the hand while the issue for which the Istikharah has been done is kept hidden in the mind. If the number of the beads in the portion held by the hand comes to be even, this will be a sign to do what has been intended to do. If conversely the number of the beads comes to be odd, this will be a sign not to do what has been intended to do, or the opposite, according to the way already decided by the doer of the Istikharah (i.e. he, before entering into this Istikharah, must first of all decide that the even number will be considered order to do and the odd will be considered warning against it, or the opposite).\r\n\r\nIn a previous section of this book; namely, Some Highly Recommended Prayers, I have referred to the Prayer of Istikharah with Sheets, other types of Istikharah, and the best times of it",
