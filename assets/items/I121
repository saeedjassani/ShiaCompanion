Once they do so, both they and the dead person will be awarded.\r\n\r\nAccording to another acceptably reported tradition, Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) has said, “When a faithful believer is entered into the grave, he hears a caller saying to him: Verily, the first of Your gifts is Paradise and the first of the gifts of those who followed you (in your funeral ceremony) is forgiveness.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another tradition, Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) has said, “The first gift of a faithful believer in his grave is that all those who have followed his funeral will be forgiven.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another tradition, Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) has said, “Whoever follows the funeral of a faithful believer to the grave, Almighty Allah will order seventy angels to escort him on the Resurrection Day and to implore Allah’s forgiveness for him from the grave to the situation of the Judgement.”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) is also reported to have said, “Whoever participates in carrying the coffin of a dead faithful believer, Almighty Allah will forgive twenty-five of his grand sins. If he carries the four legs (consecutively) of the coffin, all his sins will be forgiven.”\r\n\r\nCARRYING THE DEAD PERSON AND THE COFFIN\r\n\r\nThe coffin should be carried by four men and it is better for the one who escorts the deceased to start with carrying the dead body from the side of the right hand, which is situated to the left side of the coffin. Then, he should carry the body from the side of the right leg. Turning to the backside of the coffin, he should then carry the side of the left leg on the left shoulder and then the side of the left hand on the left shoulder. If he intends to take another tour, he must avoid passing from the front side of the coffin; rather, he must turn from its backside. Hence, this tour starts with carrying the side of the right hand of the deceased in the same previous way. However, this way is contradictory to the instruction of the majority of scholars, who have instructed that the point from which a coffin should be carried begins with the right side of the front of the coffin followed by carrying the right side of the coffin from the backside. Then, the left side is carried from the backside and then from the front side.\r\n\r\nHowever, the earlier way is in fact corresponding with the most validly reported traditions. Most preferably, the two ways may be followed.\r\n\r\nIt is also most preferable to walk either behind or to the two side of the coffin rather than in front of it. Yet, the majority of traditions apparently maintain that it is better to walk in front of the coffin of the faithful believers and it is disapproved to walk in front of the coffin of the dead person who follows another sect (i.e. non-Shi’ite), for the angel receives the coffin with chastisement. Finally, it is discommended to follow a funeral riding.",
