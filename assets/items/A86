The Holy Prophet (S) said that if a person recites this Surah frequently in his prayers then on the Day of Judgement there will be no curtain between Allah (S.w.T.) and himself and when his book of deeds will be opened, Allah (S.w.T.) will protect him from humiliation.\r\n\r\nIf a prisoner writes this Surah and keeps it with him, he will be released sooner and he will be saved from any dangers.
