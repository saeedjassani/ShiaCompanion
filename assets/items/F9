    "content": "NAMAZ E WAHSHAT\r\n\r\nThe prayer to be offered at the burial night consists of two units. In the first unit, Surah al-Faatehah and Ayah al-Kursi are recited. In the second unit, Surah al-Faatehah is recited one time and Surah al-Qadr repeated ten times. When you say the Taslim statement, you may say the following supplication:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّابْعَثْ ثَوَابَهَا اِلٰى قَبْرِ ۔۔۔--ANOTHER NAMAZ AT THE BURIAL NIGHT\r\n\r\nSayyid Ibn Tawus, may Allah have mercy upon him, has reported that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said, “The harshest time for a dead is his first night in the grave. Therefore, have mercy upon your dead people through almsgiving. If you do not have anything to give as alms, you may offer a two-unit prayer, reciting Surah al-Faatehah once and Surah al-Tawheed twice in the first unit and Surah al-Faatehah once and Surah al-Takathur ten times in the second unit. When you accomplish the prayer (by uttering the Taslim statement), you may say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّابْعَثْ ثَوَابَهَا اِلٰى قَبْرِ ذٰلِكَ الْمَيِّتِ۔۔۔--If you do so, Almighty Allah will immediately send one thousand angels to the grave of that individual; each angel carrying a dress and a garment. Moreover, Almighty Allah will expand his grave, saving him from tightness up to the day when the Trumpet will be blown. As for the one who has offered this prayer, he will be given rewards as many as every thing touched by the sunlight and he will be raised forty ranks.",
