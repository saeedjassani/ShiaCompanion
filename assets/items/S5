    "content": "In the word of the two Shaykhs, on the twenties of Safar, the harem of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) arrived in al-Madinah returning from Syria. On this day too, Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah al-Ansari, the first to visit the tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.), arrived there. It is recommended to visit the holy tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) on this day. Concerning this, Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari(a.s.) is reported to have said:\r\n\r\n“The signs of a true believer are five: (1) offering a fifty-one units of Daily obligatory and supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) prayers, (2) visiting the tomb of Imam al-Husayn on the twentieth of Safar (i.e. Ziyarat al-Arba’in), (3) putting a ring in the right hand, (4) covering one’s forehead with dust (i.e. prostrating oneself to Almighty Allah earnestly), and (5) repeating the Basmalah (Bismil-lahir-rahmanir-rahim: In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful) audibly in certain prayers.\r\n\r\nIn Tahdhib al-Ahkam and al-Misbah, Shaykh al-Tusi has mentioned a form of Ziyarah that is dedicated to this day. Later in the book, this form will be cited.",
