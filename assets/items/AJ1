The first of the Four Pillar-Persons, Salman was given an exclusive excellence by the Holy Prophet (s) who said about him, “Salman belongs to us - the Ahl al-Bayt.” Thus, the Holy Prophet (s) included Salman with the group of the Household of Prophethood and Infallibility.\r\n\r\nDeclaring the value of Salman, the Holy Prophet (s) also said,\r\n\r\nImam ‘Ali Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a) likened Salman to Luqman whom Almighty Allah gave wisdom.\r\n\r\nImam al-Sadiq (‘a) regarded Salman as even preferred to Luqman the wise.\r\n\r\nAs for Imam al-Baqir (‘a), he considered Salman to be one of those who understand by tokens (mutawassim).\r\n\r\nFrom the traditions on the merits of Salman, we can conclude the following:\r\n\r\n1. Salman had knowledge with the Greater Name (alism al-a’zam).\r\n\r\n2. He received directly from the angels.\r\n\r\n3. Faith is of ten ranks; Salman attained the tenth (i.e. most supreme) rank.\r\n\r\n4. He had familiarity with the unseen knowledge and the knowledge of the times of death.\r\n\r\n5. In this worldly life, Salman ate from the presents of Paradise.\r\n\r\n6. Paradise longs for and loves Salman.\r\n\r\n7. Almighty Allah and His Messengers love Salman.\r\n\r\n8. Almighty Allah ordered His Messenger to love four persons one of whom was Salman.\r\n\r\n9. Verses of the Holy Qur’an were revealed in praise of Salman and his matches.\r\n\r\n10. Whenever Archangel Gabriel descended to the Holy Prophet (s), he would order him to convey compliments of Almighty Allah to Salman and inform him of the knowledge of times of death, future catastrophes, and lineages of people.\r\n\r\n11. At nights, Salman held special sessions with the Holy Prophet (s).\r\n\r\n12. The Holy Prophet (s) and Imam ‘Ali (‘a) taught Salman a portion of the stored and hidden knowledge of Almighty Allah - the knowledge that none could bear except Salman.\r\n\r\n13. He attained such a magnificent prominence due to which Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) said about him:\r\n\r\nIn the course of arousing desire for visiting the tomb of this great personality, it is sufficient to reflect on the following peculiarity and great preference by which Salman was characterized among all of the companions of the Holy Prophet (s):\r\n\r\nWhen Salman passed away, Imam ‘Ali (‘a) covered the entire distance between al-Madinah and al-Mada’in in one night to attend his funeral ceremony. The Imam (‘a) himself washed and coffined the dead body of Salman. He then performed the ritual Deceased Prayer for his body in the participation of a line of angels. At that night, the Imam (‘a) returned to al-Madinah. What a sublime honor the loyalty to and love for the Ahl al-Bayt grant. Such loyalty and love raises one to such a splendid status and supreme rank.",
