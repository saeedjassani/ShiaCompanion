    "content": "12TH OF RABI’ AL-AWWAL\r\n\r\nAccording to the opinion of al-Kulayni and al-Mas’udi, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was born on the twelfth of Rabi’ al-Awwal. This is also the unanimous opinion of the other Muslim sects. It is thus recommended to offer a two unit prayer with Surah al-Faatehah once and Surah al-Tawheed three times at the first unit, and Surah al-Faatehah once and Surah al-Kafirun (No. 109) three times at the second.\r\n\r\nOn this day too, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) entered the holy city of al-Madinah after he had left Makkah.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Tusi adds that on this day in AH 132, the Marwanid Dynasty perished.\r\n\r\n14TH OF RABI’ AL-AWWAL\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of Rabi’ al-Awwal AH 64, Yazid ibn Mu’awiyah, the Umayyad tyrant, perished and, thus, hurried to join the lowest stage of Hellfire. According to the book of Akhbar al-Duwal, Yazid was infected by pleurisy in Hawran. His dead body was thus moved to Damascus where he was buried in al-Bab al-Saghir. His grave is now a dunghill. He lived thirty-seven years and ruled for three years and nine months.\r\n\r\n17TH NIGHT OF RABI’ AL-AWWAL\r\n\r\nAt the seventeenth night of Rabi’ al-Awwal, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), the Seal of the Prophets, was born. It is thus a very blessed night.\r\n\r\nSayyid Ibn Tawus has narrated that one year before Hegira, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) ascended to the seven heavens at the seventeenth night of Rabi’ al-Awwal.",
