I swear by Allah, any believing individual who supplicates Almighty Allah with this supplication after the prayers will most certainly be forgiven by Almighty Allah, even if his sins have been as many as the stars in the sky, the drops coming down from the sky, the pebbles, and the stones of the earth.”\r\n\r\nImam Ali(a.s.) clarified, “I have full knowledge of that. Allah is Ample-giving and Knowing.”\r\n\r\nThe man, who was al-Khidr, commented, “You, O Commander of the Faithful, have said the truth. I swear it by Allah. Verily, above every one possessed of knowledge, there is a more knowledgeable one.”\r\n\r\nAl-Kaf’ami has also reported the supplication in his book of al-Balad al-Amin.\r\n\r\nThe supplication is the following:\r\n\r\n--يَا مَنْ لَا يَشْغَلُهُ سَمْعٌ عَنْ سَمْعٍ يَا مَنْ لَا يُغَلِّطُهُ السَّاۤئِلُوْنَ وَيَا مَنْ لَا يُبْرِمُهُ اِلْحَاحُ الْمُلِحِّيْنَ اَذِقْنِىْ بَرْدَ عَفْوِكَ وَمَغْفِرَتِكَ وَحَلَاوَةَ رَحْمَتِكَ۔--Twentieth: In his book of A’lam al-Din, Ibn ‘Abbas reported the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) to have said, “He who recites the following three Quranic verses three times after the Sunset (Maghrib) Prayer will be regarded as having settled all that which he missed on that day and his prayer will be accepted. If he recites them after every obligatory or voluntary prayer, rewards that are as numerous as the stars of the sky, the drops of rain, the leaves of trees, and the pieces of the soil of the earth will be recorded for him. After he dies, for each single reward, ten rewards will be recorded for him in his grave. These Quranic verses are the following:\r\n\r\n--فَسُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ حِيْنَ تُمْسُوْنَ وَحِيْنَ تُصْبِحُوْنَ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِى السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْاَرْضِ وَعَشِيًّا وَحِيْنَ تُظْهِرُوْنَ يُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَىِّ وَيُحْيِى الْاَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَكَذٰلِكَ تُخْرَجُوْنَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّكَ رَبِّ الْعِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُوْنَ وَسَلَامٌ عَلَى الْمُرْسَلِيْنَ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ۔",
