    "content": "Shaykh al-Tusi, Sayyid Ibn Baqi, and Shaykh al-Kafâ€™ami have divided the day into twelve hours, dedicating each hour to one of the Twelve Imams (a.s.) and mentioning an advocacy-seeking supplication (i.e. tawassul) addressed to the Imam of that hour. Although these master scholars have not mentioned any tradition that is reported from the Holy Imams (a.s.) about this division, we, depending on the high regard of these scholars, can say that they would never say or do anything unless they had acquainted themselves with a narration indicating that saying or deed. However, in this brief book, I will mention only the supplicatory prayers that I have quoted from the book of Misbah al-Mutahajjid (by Shaykh al-Tusi).",
