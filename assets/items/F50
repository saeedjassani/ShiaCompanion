In both units, you should recite Surah al-Faatehah once and repeat Surah al-Tawheed five hundred times. After repeating this Surah in the second unit, you may recite the last verses of Surah al-Hashr:\r\n\r\n--لَوْ اَنْزَلْنَا هٰذَا الْقُرْاۤنُ۔۔۔--You may then recite the first six verses of Surah al-Hadid. While standing up, you may then repeat the following holy verse one thousand times:\r\n\r\n--اِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَ اِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِيْنُ۔--You may then accomplish your prayer and praise Almighty Allah.\r\n\r\nIf your need is not settled, you may repeat this prayer. If it is still not settled, you may repeat it once more and your need will be settled, Allah willing.",
