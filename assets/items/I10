    "content": "The traditions, reported from the Holy Imams (a.s.) about the merit of Tasbih al-Zahra’, are too many to be counted. Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said, “We order our boys to do Tasbih al-Zahra’ in the same effect that we order them to perform the obligatory prayers. Hence, you should abide by it, because misery will never find a way to a servant who constantly say it.”\r\n\r\nAccording to validly reported traditions, the “frequent remembrance” that is mentioned and ordered in the Holy Qur’an indicates Tasbih al-Zahra’; therefore, whoever abides by it will have remembered Almighty Allah frequently and carried out the order decreed in this holy verse:\r\n\r\n--فَاذْكُرُوْا للهَ ذِكْرًا كَثِيْرًا--Through a valid chain of authority (i.e. sanad), Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) is reported to have said, “Whoever glorifies Almighty Allah with the doxology (zikr) (Tasbih) of Fatimah (a.s.) and then ends it with imploring Almighty Allah’s forgiveness, Almighty Allah will forgive him. This doxology (zikr) is one hundred (words) with tongues, but one thousand (rewards) in the Scale. It also dismisses Satan and pleases the Lord.”\r\n\r\nThrough an authentic (i.e. sahih) chain of authority, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said, “Whoever glorifies Almighty Allah with the doxology (zikr) (Tasbih) of Fatimah (a.s.) before he extends his legs after an obligatory prayer, Almighty Allah will forgive him and Paradise will be absolutely decided for him.”\r\n\r\nThrough another valid (i.e. mu’tabar) chain of authority, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said, “The doxology (zikr) of Fatimah al-Zahra’(a.s.) subsequent to every obligatory prayer is dearer to me than offering one thousand units of prayer every day.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another validly reported tradition, Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) is reported to have said, “No statements of glorification and adoration through which Almighty Allah is worshipped can be better than the doxology (zikr) of Fatimah (a.s.). If there had been any thing better than this, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) would certainly have given to Fatimah (a.s.).”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the traditions about the merits of Tasbih al-Zahra’are too numerable to be all mentioned in this book.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF TASBIH AL-ZAHRA’\r\n\r\nAlthough traditions have not mentioned a unanimous method of Tasbih al-Zahra’, the most famous and apparent method is as follows:\r\n\r\nRepeat the following phrase thirty-four times:\r\n\r\n--اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ--Repeat the following phrase thirty-three times:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ--Repeat the following phrase thirty-three times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللهِ--However, some traditions have mentioned that the last statement (i.e. subhana allahi) is preceded to the second (i.e. alhamdu lillahi). Some scholars have therefore tried to bring all the traditions to agreement, by saying that the earlier method may be said after the obligatory prayers while the latter may be said before sleep. However, the earlier method, which is the most famous, may be apparently applied before sleep and after obligatory prayers. It is a tradition (i.e. confirmedly recommended) to say the following statement after accomplishing Tasbih al-Zahra’:\r\n\r\n--لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ--Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported to have said, “Whoever glorifies (Almighty Allah) with Tasbih al-Zahra’ after every obligatory prayer and follows it with la ilaha illaAllahu, Almighty Allah will forgive him.”",
