His holy tomb, which is in the city of Ray (southern Tehran, Iran), is famous. It is a haven and a shelter for the publics. The high standing and majestic position of ‘Abd al-’Azim is clearer than sunlight. First of all, he is from the descendants of the Seal of the Prophets. He is also one of the master traditionists, great scholars, ascetics, and worshippers, and well-known for his distinguished religiousness and piety. He was within the companions of Imam al-Jawad and Imam al-Hadi whom he used to take as means to Almighty Allah and to whom he adhered distinguishably. He also reported many traditions from these two Holy Imams.\r\n\r\nHe was the author of the books entitled Khutab Amir al-Mu’minin (Sermons of the Commander of the Faithful) and al-Yawm wal-Laylah (The Day and the Night).\r\n\r\nHis story of providing his beliefs before Imam al-Hadi (‘a) is famous. The Imam (‘a) then said to him, “O Abu’l-Qasim, this is by Allah the very religion that Allah has accepted for His servants; therefore, you should keep on it. Allah may strengthen your faith by the true Words in this world and in the life to come.”\r\n\r\nAl-Sahib ibn ‘Abbad wrote a brief thesis about the biography of this man. This thesis has been quoted by our mentor Shaykh al-Nuri in the epilogue of his book entitled al-Mustadrak.\r\n\r\nIn this book, as well as the famous book of biography known as Rijal al-Kashshi, it has been recorded that when ‘Abd al-’Azim feared for himself the persecution of the ruling authorities, he had to leave for several countries disguising. He then came to the city of Ray and resided in Sarbanan. He confided himself in a vault in a house of a Shi’ite man in a place called Sikkat al-Mawla. He used to worship Almighty Allah in that vault by spending his days fasting and his nights doing acts of worship. Disguising himself, he used to leave that vault for visiting the tomb that would be opposite to his tomb at the other side of the road. He used to say that the tomb was for one of the descendants of Imam Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kazim, peace be upon him. During his stay in that vault, the Shi’ah reported his manners to one another until he was known by the majority of them. One night, one of these Shi’ah saw in dream the Holy Prophet (‘a) saying to him, “One of my descendants will be carried from Sikkat al-Mawla and buried next to that apple tree in the orchard of ‘Abd al-Jabbar the son of ‘Abd al-Wahhab. The man therefore went to the owner of that orchard and offered to buy that tree and its place. The owner of the orchard asked, “What for are you asking me to sell you that very tree and its place?” The man had to inform him about his dream. The owner then told him that he had seen a similar dream and, as a result, he endowed that tree and its place to the sayyids and the Shi’ah to bury their dead ones there.\r\n\r\nAfter that, ‘Abd al-’Azim became ill and passed away. May Allah have mercy upon him. When he was stripped of his clothes for performing the ritual bathing for his dead body, a sheet of paper was found in his pocket. In that sheet of paper, he had written down his lineage as follows: “I am Abu’l-Qasim ‘Abd al-’Azim the son of ‘Abdullah the son of ‘Ali the son of al-Hasan the son of Zayd the son of al-Hasan the son of ‘Ali the son of Abu-Talib.”\r\n\r\nDescribing the knowledgeability of ‘Abd al-’Azim, al-Sahib ibn ‘Abbad says that Abu-Turab al-Rawayani has reported that he heard Abu-Hammad al-Razi saying: One day, I visited Imam ‘Ali al-Naqi (al-Hadi) in Samarra’ and asked him about some legal and illegal issues of the religion. The Imam (‘a) answered all of my questions. When I bid farewell to him, he said to me, “Hammad, if you face any problem regarding your religious affairs while you are in your hometown (i.e. Ray), you may ask ‘Abd al-’Azim ibn ‘Abdullah al-Hasani. Once you do, convey my greetings to him.”\r\n\r\nMERITS OF VISITING ‘ABD AL-’AZIM\r\n\r\nIn his book of al-Rawashih, al-Muhaqqiq al-Damad says that the rewards of visiting the tomb of ‘Abd al-’Azim al-Hasani have been mentioned in confirmative traditions. One of these traditions reads that whoever visits his tomb will be awarded Paradise inevitably.\r\n\r\nThis very tradition has been also mentioned by al-Shahid al-Thani in the margin of his book of al-Khulasah as reported from some experts in lineages.\r\n\r\nIbn Babawayh and Ibn Qawlawayh have reported through a valid chain of authority that a man from the people of Ray visited Imam ‘Ali al-Hadi (‘a) who asked him where from he had come. “I came here after I had visited Imam al-Husayn,” answered the man.\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) said, “Actually, if you had visited the tomb of ‘Abd al-’Azim in your city, you would have been as if you have visited al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali, peace be upon them.”",
