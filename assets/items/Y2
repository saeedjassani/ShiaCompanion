At any rate, any form of the supplication is acceptable.\r\n\r\nAccording to narrations, the best words that are advisably said in Sha’ban are the implorations for the forgiveness of Almighty Allah (i.e. istighfar). Hence, to implore for Almighty Allah’s forgiveness seventy times a day in Sha’ban is equal to imploring for His forgiveness seventy thousand times a day in the other months.\r\n\r\nThird: It is recommended to give alms in this month even if it is as small as a half date. Almsgiving in this month brings about rescue from Hellfire. In this respect, it has been narrated that when Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) was asked about the merits of observing fasting in Rajab, he answered, “Why do you not ask about the merits of observing fasting in Sha’ban?” “What is then the reward of one who observes fasting on one day in Sha’ban?” asked the narrator. The Imam (a.s.) answered, “The reward will be Paradise. I swear it by Allah.” The narrator then asked again, “What are the best deeds that should be done in Sha’ban.” The Imam (a.s.) answered, “Almsgiving and imploring for forgiveness are the best deeds in Sha’ban. Verily, if anyone of you gives alms in Sha’ban, Almighty Allah will breed that alms in the very same way as you breed your small camels. Hence, this alms will be as huge as Mount Uhud on the Resurrection Day.”\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to repeat the following litany one thousand times in Sha’ban:\r\n\r\n--لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَ لَا نَعْبُدُ اِلَّا اِيَّاهُ مُخْلِصِيْنَ لَهُ الدِّيْنَ وَ لَوْ كَرِهَ الْمُشْرِكُوْنَ--This devout rite brings about a great reward. The reward of one who repeats this litany in Sha’ban is that one is awarded the reward of serving (Almighty Allah) for one thousand years.",
