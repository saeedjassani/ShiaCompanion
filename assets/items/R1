In this respect, Imam al-Rida(a.s.) is reported to have said, “With the beginning of Muharram, my father (a.s.) would never smile at all. He would be dominated by depression for ten days. The tenth of this month would be the day of his misfortune, sadness, and weeping. He used to say that on this day Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) was slain.”",
