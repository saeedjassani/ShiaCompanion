Imam al-Rida (‘a) is reported to have said, “Listen, son of Abu-Nasr! Wherever you are, try your best to present yourself at the tomb of Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a) on the Ghadir Day. Verily, Almighty Allah forgives the sins of sixty years of each faithful believer and Muslim individual, male and female (who presents himself/herself thereat on this day). On this day too, Almighty Allah releases from Hellfire two folds as many people as He releases during the month of Ramazan, the Grand (i.e Qadr) Night and the night before ‘Id al-Fitr Night.”\r\n\r\nA number of forms of ziyarah has been dedicated to this day:\r\n\r\nFirst: The previously mentioned ziyarah of Aminullah (the second of the untimed forms of ziyarah) may be said on the Day of Ghadir.",
