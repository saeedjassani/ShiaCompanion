    "content": "Ibn Baabwayh reports Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) to have said: Any servant (of God) that repeats the following supplication seven times everyday, Hellfire will ask Almighty Allah to protect him against it:\r\n\r\n--اَسْئَلُ اللّٰهَ الْجَنَّةَ وَ اَعُوْذُ بِاللهِ مِنَ النَّارِ۔--Through another valid chain of authority, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: Almighty Allah will certainly forgive any believer who commits forty grand sins every day and night but he then feels sorry for that and prays Almighty Allah to forgive him by saying the following imploration of forgiveness:\r\n\r\n--اَسْتَغْفِرُاللّٰهَ الَّذِىْ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا هُوَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّوْمُ بَدِيْعُ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْاَرْضِ ذُوالْجَلَالِ وَالْاِكْرَامِ وَ اَسْئَلُهُ اَنْ يَّتُوْبَ عَلَىَّ۔--Through another valid chain of authority, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: He who repeats the following doxology (zikr) seven times everyday is considered to have thanked Almighty Allah as it should be for the past and the coming graces:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ عَلٰى كُلِّ نِعْمَةٍ كَانَتْ اَوْ هِىَ كَاۤئِنَةٌ۔--Through another valid chain of authority, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: He who repeats the following supplication twenty-five times every day, Almighty Allah will record for him rewards as many as the number of all believers that have passed and all believers that will exist up to the Resurrection Day, will erase sins of the same number that he committed, and will raise him ranks of the same number, too:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِلْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ وَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَالْمُسْلِمِيْنَ وَ الْمُسْلِمَاتِ۔--Through another valid chain of authority, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: He who repeats the following litany ten times every day, Almighty Allah will fend off from him seventy kinds of tribulations the easiest of which is distress (or, according to another narration, he will never be afflicted by poverty):\r\n\r\n--لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ۔--Al-Kulayni, al-Yabrisi, and other scholars have reported through many chains of authority, some of which are acceptable (hasan) and others are valid, that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) said that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to repeat the following two supplicatory statements seventy times each:\r\n\r\n--اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ اَتُوْبُ اِلَى اللهِ۔--In the books of Kashf al-Ghummah and al-Amali by Shaykh al-Tusi, it is reported through a valid chain of authority that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said: He who repeats the following statement one hundred times every day, will be secured against poverty and loneliness in grave, will be granted richness, and the doors to Paradise will be opened before him:\r\n\r\n--لَاۤ اِلٰهَ‏ اِلَّا اللهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ الْمُبِيْنُ۔--However, this statement has been mentioned in the book of al-Amali as follows:\r\n\r\n--لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ الْمُبِيْنُ۔--According to the narration mentioned in the books of Thawab al-A’mal and al-Mahasin, this statement is repeated thirty times.",
