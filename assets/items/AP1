Of course, to shun visiting his holy tomb will be considered aversion on the Resurrection Day.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Shahid says, “If people shun visiting the tomb of the Holy Prophet, the supreme religious authority must oblige them to do so. In fact, to avoid visiting his holy tomb is considered forbidden aversion.”\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Saduq has reported Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) as saying, “If you go on hajj, you should seal it with visiting our tombs. To visit our tombs is the completion of the hajj.”\r\n\r\nImam ‘Ali Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a) is also reported as saying, “Accomplish your hajj with visiting (the tomb of) the Holy Prophet. To shun it after the hajj is aversion. You are ordered to do so. Accomplish you hajj with visiting the tombs that Almighty Allah has ordered you to honor and to visit. You should pray for sustenance thereat.”\r\n\r\nIt has been also narrated that Abu’l-Salt al-Harawi asked Imam al-Rida (‘a) to explain to him the Hadith (i.e. tradition) involving that the believers will visit their Lord while they will be in their houses in Paradise.( ) Imam al-Rida (‘a) answered, “Listen, Abu’l-Salt! Certainly, Almighty Allah has preferred His Prophet Muhammad - peace be upon him and his Household - to all His creatures, including the Prophets and the angels. He has also decided that to obey the Prophet is to obey Him, to swear allegiance to the Prophet is to swear allegiance to Him, and to visit the Prophet is to visit Him. In this respect, He says, ‘He who obeys the Messenger obeys Allah. 4/80’ ‘Verily, those who plight their fealty to you do no less than plight their fealty to Allah. 48/10’ The Holy Prophet (s) has said, ‘He who visits me during my lifetime or after my death will have visited Almighty Allah etc.’”\r\n\r\nIn Qurb al-Isnad, al-Himyari (the author) has narrated that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) reported the Holy Prophet (s) as saying, “On the Resurrection Day, I will intercede for those who visit me in my lifetime or after my death.”\r\n\r\nAnother Hadith reads that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a), once, attended a celebration at al-Madinah. He then left towards the holy tomb of the Holy Prophet (s) and greeted him. He then said to the attendants, “Verily, we (i.e. people of al-Madinah) have been preferred to all other cities, including Makkah, that we can send greeting to the Messenger of Allah (from his tomb).”\r\n\r\nMERIT OF GREETING THE HOLY PROPHET AND LADY FATIMAH AL-ZAHRA’\r\n\r\nIn Tahdhib al-Ahkam, Shaykh al-Tusi (the author) has narrated on the authority of Yazid ibn ‘Abd al-Malik on the authority of his father that his father, once, visited Lady Fatimah al-Zahra’ (‘a) who greeted his first and then asked him about the reason of his visit. “I just seek blessings,” answered he. She said, “My father has informed me that Almighty Allah will decide Paradise for one who greets him and me for three consecutive days.” “Does this means to greet you and him during your lifetimes?” asked he. She answered, “Yes, and also after our death.”\r\n\r\nMERIT OF VISITING THE HOLY TOMB OF IMAM AL-HASAN\r\n\r\n‘Allamah al-Majlisi says that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas, though a considerable chain of authority, reported the Holy Prophet (s) as saying, “As for anyone who visits (the tomb of) al-Hasan at al-Baqi’ Cemetery, his feet will be fixed on the Sirat (the Discriminating Bridge) when the others’ feet will quake.”\r\n\r\nMERIT OF VISITING THE HOLY TOMB OF IMAM MUHAMMAD AL-BAQIR (‘A)\r\n\r\nIn al-Kamil, Ibn Qawlawayh has narrated on the authority of Hisham ibn Salim that Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) was once visited by a person who asked him, “Is it recommended to visit the tomb of your father?” “Yes, it is,” answered the Imam (‘a). “What are the rewards of him who visits his tomb?” asked the man. The Imam (‘a) answered, “To visit his tomb while you betake him as your Imam, Paradise will be your reward.” “What is the share of him who intentionally avoids visiting him?” asked the man. The Imam (‘a) answered, “The result of such people will be regret on the Regret Day (i.e. Resurrection Day) etc.”\r\n\r\nMERITS OF VISITING THE HOLY TOMB OF IMAM JA’FAR AL-SADIQ (‘A)\r\n\r\nIn al-Muqni’ah, Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) is reported to have said, “Whoever visits me, will have all his sins forgiven and will not be inflicted with poverty or neediness.”\r\n\r\nIn Tahdhib al-Ahkam, Shaykh al-Tusi has narrated that Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari (‘a) said, “Whoever visits Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq and his father (‘a) will never suffer eye pain, will never be infected by a disease, and will not die because of an infection.”\r\n\r\nHowever, too many are the narratives that convey the merits of visiting the tombs of the Holy Imams (‘a).",
