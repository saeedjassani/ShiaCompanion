Verily, whoever recites it, Almighty Allah will gather for him both the wealth of this world and the goodness of the Hereafter and will forgive him, his parents, and their descendants.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another tradition, whoever recites Surah al-Tawheed ten times after each obligatory prayer, Almighty Allah will give him in marriage the Paradisiacal women.\r\n\r\nSayyid Ibn Tawus has reported that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said, “Whoever recites Surah al-Tawheed after each prayer, mercy from the heavens will be showered on him, tranquility will be poured down on him, Almighty Allah will look at him with the eye of mercy, forgive his sins, grant him whatever he has asked for, and he will be placed under the security of Almighty Allah.”\r\n\r\nEighteenth: Al-Kulayni, may Allah have mercy upon him, and others have reported the following from the Ahl al-Bayt (a.s.) through a considerable chain of authority:\r\n\r\nAfter each obligatory prayer, one may put his right hand on his beard and raises his left hand towards the sky, repeating the following supplicatory prayer three times:\r\n\r\n--يَا ذَاالْجَلَالِ وَالْاِكْرَامِ اِرْحَمْنِىْ مِنَ النَّارِ۔--He may then repeat the following supplicatory phrase three times, too:\r\n\r\n--اَجِرْنِىْ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ الْاَلِيْمِ۔--He may then open his right hand by making its palm face the sky, put it under the beard, and repeat the following supplication three times:\r\n\r\n--يَا عَزِيْزُ يَا كَرِيْمُ يَا رَحْمٰنُ يَا غَفُوْرُ يَا رَحِيْمُ۔--He may then turn his hands over, by making their outer part face the sky, and repeat the following supplicatory prayer three times:\r\n\r\n--اَجِرْنِىْ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ الْاَلِيْمِ۔--He may then say the following invocation:\r\n\r\n--وَصَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَاٰلِهٖ وَالْمَلَاۤئِكَةُ وَالرُّوْحُ۔--If one does all that, Almighty Allah will forgive him and will be pleased with him; and all creatures, except men and jinn, will invoke forgiveness upon him until he dies.",
