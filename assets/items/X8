    "content": "The first day of Rajab is a holy day on which there are several rites to be advisably done:\r\n\r\nFirst: It is advisable to observe fasting on this day. According to narrations, Prophet Noah (a.s.) embarked on the Ark on such a day; he therefore ordered his companions to observe fasting. Hence, whoever observes fasting on this day, Hellfire will move away from him for a distance of one year walking.\r\n\r\nSecond: Bathing oneself is also advisable on this day.\r\n\r\nThird: It is also recommended to visit the tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) on this day. Shaykh al-Tusi has narrated on the authority of Bashir al-Dahhan that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said, “Whoever visits (Imam) al-Husayn ibn Ali(a.s.) on the first day of Rajab, Almighty Allah will forgive him all his sins.”\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to say the long supplicatory prayer, particularized for this day and mentioned in the book of Iqbal al-A’mal.",
