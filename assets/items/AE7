Peace be upon you, O Allah’s argument and son of His argument. Peace be upon you, O leader to true guidance and firmest handle (of Islam). Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you. I bear witness that you passed away carrying the same principles on which your immaculate fathers had passed away. Allah’s blessings be upon them. You never preferred blindness to true guidance and never slanted from right to wrong. And you acted for the sake of Allah and His Messenger sincerely and fulfilled the trust. May Allah reward you on behalf of Islam and its embracers with the most favorable reward. I have come to you— may my father and mother be accepted as ransoms for you— visiting you, recognizing your right, declaring loyalty to your loyalists, and showing enmity towards your enemies. So, intercede for me with your Lord.\r\n\r\nYou may then throw yourself at the tomb, kiss it, put your both cheeks on it, turn to the side of the Imam’s head, and say the following words:\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you, O my master, O son of Allah’s Messenger. Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you. I bear witness that you are verily the guiding leader and the directing saint. I repudiate your enemies in the presence of Allah and seek nearness to Allah through declaring loyalty to you. May Allah bless you. Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you.\r\n\r\nYou may then offer the twounit prayer of ziyarah after which you may offer any prayers you wish.\r\n\r\nYou may then turn to the side of the Imam’s foot and pray Almighty Allah for anything you want."
