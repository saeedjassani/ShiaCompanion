The Imam (a.s.) therefore said to him: You may repeat the following words ten times after the dawn (fajr) Prayer:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ الْعَظيْمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللّٰهَ وَاَسْئَلُهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ۔--The man then said, “A little time after I had committed myself to this instruction, people from the desert came to me to inform that one of my relatives had died and he had no inheritor except me. I therefore went there to receive the inheritance due to which I became rich.”\r\n\r\nThe following is quoted from the two books of al-Kafi and Makarim al-Akhlaq: A man, called Halqam, asked the Holy Imam (a.s.) to teach him a brief supplicatory utterance by which the wealth of this world and the goodness of the Hereafter are gathered to him. The Imam (a.s.) therefore instructed him to say the aforementioned supplicatory utterance to be repeated after the dawn (fajr) Prayer up to sunrise. When the man did, his conditions were changed excellently.",
