    "content": "Tenth: Following Imam Jaâ€™far al-Sadiq(a.s.) it is recommended to have pomegranate at Friday nights. Yet, it is preferable to have it before going to sleep. In this respect, it has been narrated that to eat pomegranate before going to sleep procures security until morning. It is also instructive to extend a handkerchief on the ground so as to save all the seeds of a pomegranate from loss and then eat them all. It is also recommended not to share anyone with it.",
