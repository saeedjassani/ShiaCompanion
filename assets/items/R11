    "content": "Actually, there are many forms of ziyarah dedicated to the ‘Ashura’ Day. However, we will limit ourselves to mentioning two forms only. In the previous chapter on the recommended acts on the ‘Ashura’ Day, we have mentioned some forms of ziyarah and other acts corresponding to this occasion.\r\n\r\nMERITS\r\n\r\nThe first form of ziyarah to be mentioned hereinafter is the famous ziyarah of ‘Ashura’, which can be said at the tomb of Imam al-Husayn (‘a) and also from far distance. The following is the elaborate report of this form of ziyarah, as has been narrated by Shaykh Abu-Ja’far al-Tusi in his book of al-Misbah:\r\n\r\nMuhammad ibn Isma’il ibn Buzaygh has reported on the authority of Salih ibn ‘Aqabah on the authority of his father on the authority of Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (‘a) who said, “Whoever visits al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (‘a) on the tenth of Muharram (i.e. the ‘Ashura’ Day) and remains there weeping, will meet Almighty Allah on the day of meeting Him having the reward of two thousand times of going on hajj, two thousand times of going on ‘umrah, as well as the reward of one who has participated with the Holy Messenger of Allah and with the Holy Imams in two thousand campaigns.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter asked, “May Allah accept me as ransom for you! What should one who lives in remote regions and cannot come to the tomb on that day do?”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) explained, “As for such people, they may come out to a wasteland or go up a high roof in their houses, wave towards Imam al-Husayn (‘a) with greeting, invoke earnestly curses on those who killed him, and then offer a two-unit prayer. They may do so before midday (zohr). They may then mourn and weep for al-Husayn (‘a) and order those who live with them in their houses to weep for him, unless they fear for themselves from certain individuals who live with them. They may hold mournful ceremonies in their houses and show grief for him. They may also console one another on this terrible occasion of Imam al-Husayn’s sufferings. If they do all that, I myself guarantee for them to grant the rewards that I have mentioned beforehand.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter asked, “May Allah accept me as ransom for you! Do you really promise them and guarantee for them to have that reward?”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) answered, “Yes, I do. I do promise them and guarantee for them having that reward.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter asked, “In which method should we console one another on this occasion?”\r\n\r\nThe Imam instructed, “You may address the following words at one another:\r\n\r\n--اَعْظَمَ اللهُ اُجُوْرَنَا وَاُجُوْرَكُمْ بِمُصَابِنَا بِالْحُسَيْنِ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ وَجَعَلَنَا وَاِيَّاكُمْ مِنَ الطَّالِبِيْنَ بِثَارِهِ مَعَ وَلِيِّهِ الْاِمَامِ الْمَهْدِىِّ مِنْ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّلَامُ۔--If possible, you may not leave your house on that day to settle any of your needs, because this day is doomed and no need of a faithful believer is settled on it; and even if it is settled, it will be unblessed. Moreover, whatever is saved on this day will be unblessed and so will be his family members. If they do all that, they will have the reward of one thousand times of hajj and one thousand times of ‘umrah as well as one thousand participations in campaigns with the Holy Messenger of Allah. They will also gain the reward of all misfortunes that have inflicted every prophet, prophet’s successor, veracious, and martyr who have died or been killed since Almighty Allah has created this world up to the Resurrection Hour.”\r\n\r\nSalih ibn ‘Aqabah and Sayf ibn ‘Umayrah have reported ‘Alqamah ibn Muhammad al-Hazrami as saying that he, once, asked Imam al-Baqir, Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him, to teach him a supplicatory prayer with which he would pray Almighty Allah on that day (of ‘Ashura’) when he would visit Imam al-Husayn’s tomb and to teach him another supplicatory prayer with which he would pray Almighty Allah on that day when he would be unable to visit the tomb and then he would point to the tomb and send greetings to Imam al-Husayn (‘a) from his own house.\r\n\r\nThe Imam thus said, “Listen, ‘Alqamah! After you point to Imam al-Husayn (‘a) with greetings and offer the two-unit prayer, you may utter the Takbir statement (i.e. allahu-akbar) and then say... (the forthcoming form of Ziyarah). If you do so, you will have said the prayer that is said by the angels who visit Imam al-Husayn (‘a). You will be also raised one hundred million ranks to join the rank of those who were martyred with him (i.e. Imam al-Husayn) and you will be included with their group. You will, moreover, be awarded the reward of the visiting of all Prophets and Messengers as well as the reward of all the visitors of Imam al-Husayn (‘a) since the day of his martyrdom. Peace of Allah be upon him and upon his household.”\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\n\r\nThe form of ziyarah of ‘Ashura’ is as follow:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَاۤ اَبَا عَبْدِ اللهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ

from your house. If you do, you will have the entire reward of that ziyarah.”", 
    "english": "Actually, there are many forms of ziyarah dedicated to the ‘Ashura’ Day. However, we will limit ourselves to mentioning two forms only. In the previous chapter on the recommended acts on the ‘Ashura’ Day, we have mentioned some forms of ziyarah and other acts corresponding to this occasion.\r\n\r\nMERITS\r\n\r\nThe first form of ziyarah to be mentioned hereinafter is the famous ziyarah of ‘Ashura’, which can be said at the tomb of Imam alHusayn (‘a) and also from far distance. The following is the elaborate report of this form of ziyarah, as has been narrated by Shaykh AbuJa’far alTusi in his book of alMisbah:\r\n\r\nMuhammad ibn Isma’il ibn Buzaygh has reported on the authority of Salih ibn ‘Aqabah on the authority of his father on the authority of Imam Muhammad alBaqir (‘a) who said, “Whoever visits alHusayn ibn ‘Ali (‘a) on the tenth of Muharram (i.e. the ‘Ashura’ Day) and remains there weeping, will meet Almighty Allah on the day of meeting Him having the reward of two thousand times of going on hajj, two thousand times of going on ‘umrah, as well as the reward of one who has participated with the Holy Messenger of Allah and with the Holy Imams in two thousand campaigns.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter asked, “May Allah accept me as ransom for you! What should one who lives in remote regions and cannot come to the tomb on that day do?”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) explained, “As for such people, they may come out to a wasteland or go up a high roof in their houses, wave towards Imam alHusayn (‘a) with greeting, invoke earnestly curses on those who killed him, and then offer a twounit prayer. They may do so before midday. They may then mourn and weep for alHusayn (‘a) and order those who live with them in their houses to weep for him, unless they fear for themselves from certain individuals who live with them. They may hold mournful ceremonies in their houses and show grief for him. They may also console one another on this terrible occasion of Imam alHusayn’s sufferings. If they do all that, I myself guarantee for them to grant the rewards that I have mentioned beforehand.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter asked, “May Allah accept me as ransom for you! Do you really promise them and guarantee for them to have that reward?”\r\n\r\nThe Imam (‘a) answered, “Yes, I do. I do promise them and guarantee for them having that reward.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter asked, “In which method should we console one another on this occasion?”\r\n\r\nThe Imam instructed, “You may address the following words at one another:\r\n\r\nMay Allah double up our rewards on account of our sorrow for (the martyrdom of) al-Husayn, peace be upon him, and may He include you and us with those who shall take revenge upon his killers with his blood-claimer; Imam al-Mahdi who belongs to the Household of Muhammad, peace be upon them all.\r\n\r\nIf possible, you may not leave your house on that day to settle any of your needs, because this day is doomed and no need of a faithful believer is settled on it; and even if it is settled, it will be unblessed. Moreover, whatever is saved on this day will be unblessed and so will be his family members. If they do all that, they will have the reward of one thousand times of hajj and one thousand times of ‘umrah as well as one thousand participations in campaigns with the Holy Messenger of Allah. They will also gain the reward of all misfortunes that have inflicted every prophet, prophet’s successor, veracious, and martyr who have died or been killed since Almighty Allah has created this world up to the Resurrection Hour.”\r\n\r\nSalih ibn ‘Aqabah and Sayf ibn ‘Umayrah have reported ‘Alqamah ibn Muhammad alHazrami as saying that he, once, asked Imam alBaqir, Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him, to teach him a supplicatory prayer with which he would pray Almighty Allah on that day (of ‘Ashura’) when he would visit Imam alHusayn’s tomb and to teach him another supplicatory prayer with which he would pray Almighty Allah on that day when he would be unable to visit the tomb and then he would point to the tomb and send greetings to Imam alHusayn (‘a) from his own house.\r\n\r\nThe Imam thus said, “Listen, ‘Alqamah! After you point to Imam alHusayn (‘a) with greetings and offer the twounit prayer, you may utter the Takbir statement (i.e. allahuakbar) and then say... (the forthcoming form of Ziyarah). If you do so, you will have said the prayer that is said by the angels who visit Imam alHusayn (‘a). You will be also raised one hundred million ranks to join the rank of those who were martyred with him (i.e. Imam alHusayn) and you will be included with their group. You will, moreover, be awarded the reward of the visiting of all Prophets and Messengers as well as the reward of all the visitors of Imam alHusayn (‘a) since the day of his martyrdom. Peace of Allah be upon him and upon his household.”( )\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\n\r\nThe form of ziyarah of ‘Ashura’ is as follow:\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you, O Abu-'Abdullah. Peace be upon you, O son of Allah’s Messenger. Peace be upon you, O choicest of Allah and son of His choicest. Peace be upon you, O son of the Commander of the Faithful and son of the chief of the Prophets’ successors. Peace be upon you, O son of Fatimah the doyenne of the women of the worlds. Peace be upon you, O vengeance of Allah, son of His vengeance, and the unavenged so far. Peace be upon you and upon the souls that resided in your courtyard. Peace of Allah be upon all of you from me forever as long as I am existent and as long as there are day and night. O Abu-'Abdullah, unbearable is the sorrow and excruciating and unbearable is the misfortune of you for us and for all the people of Islam. Excruciating and unbearable has been your misfortune in the heavens for all the inhabitants of the heavens. So, may Allah curse the people who laid the basis of persecution and wronging against you, O Members of the Household. May Allah curse the people who drove you away from your position and removed you away from your ranks that Allah has put you in. May Allah curse the people who slew you. May Allah curse those who paved the way for them to do so and who made possible for them to fight against you. I repudiate them in the presence of Allah and You and I repudiate their devotees, followers, and loyalists. O Abu-'Abdullah, I am at peace with those who are at peace with you and I am at war against those who have fought against you up to the Resurrection Day. May Allah also curse the family of Ziyad and the family of Marwan. May Allah also curse the descendants of Umayyah altogether. May Allah also curse the son of Marjanah. May Allah also curse 'Umar the son of Sa'd. May Allah also curse Shimr. May Allah also curse the people who saddled up, gave reins to their horses, and masked their faces in preparation for fighting against you. May my father and mother be ransoms for you. Extremely insufferable is my commiserations with you; so, I beseech Allah Who has honored your position and honored me because of you to endue me with the chance to avenge you with a (Divinely) supported leader from the Household of Muhammad, peace of Allah be upon him and his Household. O Allah, (please) make me illustrious in Your sight in the name of al-Husayn, peace be upon him, in this world and in the Hereafter. O Abu-'Abdullah, I do seek nearness to Allah, to His Messenger, to the Commander of the Faithful, to Fatimah, to al-Hasan, and to you by means of loyalty to you and by means of repudiation of those who fought against you and incurred your hostility, and repudiation of those who laid the basis of persecution and wronging against you all. I also repudiate, in the presence of Allah and His Messenger, those who laid the basis of all that, established their foundations on it, and continued in wronging and persecuting you and your adherents. In the presence of Allah and you all do I repudiate these.• And !seek nearness to Allah and then to you all by means of declaring loyalty to you and to your loyalists and declaring repudiation of your enemies and those who incur animosity of you and repudiation of their adherents and followers. I am verily at peace with those who have been at peace with you, I am at war against those who fought against you, loyalist to those who have been loyalist to you, and enemy of those who have shown enmity towards you. So, I beseech Allah Who has endued me with the honor of recognizing you and recognizing your loyalists and Who conferred upon me with repudiation of your enemies, to include me with you in this world and in the Hereafter and to make firm step of honesty for me with you in this world and in the Hereafter. I also beseech Him to make me attain the praiseworthy status that you enjoy with Allah and to bestow upon me with the chance to take my own vengeance with a leader of true guidance who is (Divinely) sustained and expressing the truth from among you. I also beseech Allah in your names and in the name of the standing that you enjoy with Him to recompense me for my commiserations for you with the most favorite thing that He ever gives as compensation for misfortunes that has afflicted anyone. (Your) misfortune has been so astounding and so catastrophic for Islam and for all the heavens and the entire earth. O Allah, (please) make me in this situation of mine one of those who receive blessings, mercy, and forgiveness from You. O Allah, (please) make me live my lifetime in the same way as Muhammad and Muhammad’s Household lived and make me die on the same principles on which Muhammad and Muhammad’s Household died. O Allah, this day has been regarded as blessed day by the descendants of Umayyah and by the son of the liver-eater woman, the accursed and son of the accursed by the tongue of You and by the tongue of Your Prophet, Allah’s peace be upon him, on every occasion and in every situation, which Your Prophet, Allah’s peace be upon him, attended. O Allah, pour curses upon Abü-Sufyân, Mu'awiyah, and Yazid son of Mu'awiyah. May Your curse be upon them incessantly and everlastingly. This is the day on which the family of Ziyad and the family of Marwan gloated because they had killed al-Husayn, Allah’s blessings be upon him. So, O Allah, pour frequent curses upon them and double for them the painful chastisement. O Allah, I do seek nearness to You on this day, on this occasion, and on all the days of my lifetime, by repudiating these and invoking Your curses upon them, and by declaring loyalty to Your Prophet and Your Prophet’s Household, peace be upon him and them.\r\n\r\nYou may then repeat the following words one hundred times:\r\n\r\nO Allah, pour curses upon the foremost persecutor who usurped the right of Muhammad and Muhammad’s Household and the last follower who acceded to his deed. O Allah, pour curses upon the gang that struggled against alii us ay n and who supported each other against him, paid homage to his enemies, and participated in slaying him. O Allah, pour curses upon all of them.\r\n\r\nYou may then repeat the following words one hundred times:\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you, O Abu-'Abdullah and upon the souls that gathered in your courtyard. Peace of Allah be upon you from me forever as long as I am existent and as long as there are day and night. May Allah not cause this (visit) to be the last of my visit to you (all). Peace be upon al-Husayn, upon ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn, upon the sons of al-Husayn, and upon the companions of al-Husayn.\r\n\r\nYou may then say the following words:\r\n\r\nO Allah, pour special curses on the foremost persecutor and begin with him first, and then pour curses on the second, the third, and the fourth. O Allah, curse Yazld fifthly, and curse 'Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, the son of Marjanah, 'Umar ibn Sa'd, Shimr, the family of Abu-Sufyan, the family of Ziyad, and the family of Marwan up to the Resurrection Day.\r\n\r\nYou may then prostrate yourself and say the following words meanwhile:\r\n\r\nO Allah, all praise be to You; the praise of those who thank You for their misfortunes. All praise be to Allah for my great misfortune. O Allah, (please) grant me the intercession of al-Husayn on the Day of Coming (to You) and make for me with You a firm step of honesty with al-Husayn and the companions of al-Husayn who sacrificed their souls in defense of al-Husayn, peace be upon him.\r\n\r\n‘Alqamah added: Imam alBaqir (‘a) said, “If possible, you may visit him (i.e. alHusayn) with this form of ziyarah every day from your house. If you do, you will have the entire reward of that ziyarah.”"
