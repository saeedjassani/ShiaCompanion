    "content": "SURAH AL-KAAFIRUN (THE DISBELIEVERS)\r\n\r\nThis Surah is ‘Makki’ and has 6 verses. The Holy Prophet (S) said that reciting this Surah carries the reward of reciting a quarter of the Holy Qur’an. The recitation of this Surah drives away Shaitan and keeps one safe from Shirk.\r\n\r\nIt is also among the five Surahs that have been recommended to be recited during a journey, the others being Surah an-Nasr, at-Tawhid, al-Falaq and an-Naas. Reciting Surah al-Kafirun and at-Tawhid in compulsory prayers is a means for forgiveness of sins for the reciter, his parents and his children. If a person dies after reciting this Surah, it is as if he has died a martyr. Recitation of this Surah before sleeping keeps one safe the whole night.\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ--قُلْ يٰۤاَيُّهَا الْكٰفِرُوْنَۙ‏(1)--لَاۤ اَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُوْنَۙ‏(2)--وَلَاۤ اَنْتُمْ عٰبِدُوْنَ مَاۤ اَعْبُدُ‌ ۚ‏(3)--وَلَاۤ اَنَا عَابِدٌ مَّا عَبَدْتُّمْۙ‏(4)--وَ لَاۤ اَنْتُمْ عٰبِدُوْنَ مَاۤ اَعْبُدُ ؕ‏(5)--لَكُمْ دِيْنُكُمْ وَلِىَ دِيْنِ‏(6)",
