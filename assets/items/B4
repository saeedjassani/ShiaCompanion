    "content": "In point of fact, the previous recommendation of Shaykh al-Shahid manifests the horrible amount of hideousness and repulsiveness that some women, these days, commit. As they come to the holy shrines, they adorn themselves, put on their best clothes, and stand side by side with men inside the holy shrines. They, moreover, push men with their bodies so as to find themselves places near the holy tombs, or sit in the direction of the kiblah where men offer prayers for reciting the ziyarah formulas. They thus attract attentions and divert men from acts of worship, beseeching to Almighty Allah, and weeping for themselves at these sacred areas. By doing so, they bring to themselves sins and offenses. The ziyarahs of such women must be decided as discommendable acts that bring about chastisement, not acts of worship. In this respect, Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (‘a) has reported Imam ‘Ali Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a) as saying to the people of Iraq, “I have been informed that your women are meeting men on the public ways. Are you not ashamed? Curse of Allah be upon him who is not jealous.”\r\n\r\nIn man-la-yahzuruhu’l-faqih, it is mentioned that al-Asbagh ibn Nubatah reported Imam ‘Ali Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a) as saying, “In the last of time, which is actually the worst of ages, when the Hour (of Resurrection) comes near, there will appear women - unveiling themselves, exposing themselves, adorning themselves, being out of the religion, entering in seditious matters, inclining to lusts, hurrying to their pleasures, and violating the inviolable things; therefore, they will abide in Hellfire forever.”\r\n\r\nTwenty-Eighth: When the area around the holy tombs is overcrowded, those who are nearest to the holy tombs are required to hurry up and end their ziyarah so as to give others the opportunity to come near the holy tomb and win the honor of approaching these holy tombs.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the ziyarah of the holy shrine of Imam al-Husayn (‘a) enjoys particular etiquettes to which I will refer later on.",
