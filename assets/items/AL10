    "content": "Near the tombs of Imam al-Hadi and Imam al-’Askari (‘a), there lies the tomb of al-Husayn the son of Imam al-Hadi and the brother of Imam al-’Askari as well as other tombs of great personalities from the descendants of the Holy Prophet (i.e. sayyids). Although I, personally, have not put my hand on the biography of al-Husayn, he seems to have been one of the sublime and great personalities. Some traditions have mentioned that Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari (‘a) and his brother al-Husayn were called the two grandsons, being resembled to the two grandsons of the Holy Prophet; namely, Imam al-Hasan and Imam al-Husayn the sons of Imam ‘Ali, peace be upon them all.\r\n\r\nAccording to the tradition reported by Abu’l-Tayyib, the voice of Imam al-Mahdi (‘a) was similar to the voice of al-Husayn.\r\n\r\nIn his book of Shajarat al-Awliya’, Sayyid Ahmad al-Ardukani al-Yazdi, the wise jurisprudent and traditionist, mentioning the sons of Imam ‘Ali al-Hadi, says that his son al-Husayn was one of the famous ascetics and worshippers and he professed the Imamate of his brother.\r\n\r\nA deep investigation may lead to more points of the virtues and sublimity of this personality than what I have obtained.",
