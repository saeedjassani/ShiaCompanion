    "content": "Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) is reported to have said that one who offers the following prayer at Masjid al-Kufah will have all his requests settled: One may offer a two-unit prayer reciting at each unit Surahs al-Fatihah, al-Falaq (No. 113), al-Nas (No. 114), al-Tawhid (No. 112), al-Kafirun (No. 109), al-Nasr (No. 110), al-Qadr (No. 97), and al-A’la (No. 87). After accomplishment, one may say the Tasbih al-Zahra’ litany and then beseech Almighty Allah for settling his needs.\r\n\r\nThis order of Surahs is corresponding with the order adopted by Sayyid Ibn Tawus in his book of al-Misbah, while according to the narration of Shaykh al-Tusi in his book of al-Amali, Surah al-Qadr follows Surah al-A’la. Possibly, the commitment to the order of the Surahs is not obligatory; therefore, it is acceptable to recite these seven Surahs in any order as long as Surah al-Fatihah precedes the others. Finally, Almighty Allah knows best.",
