    "content": "AAMAL OF EID UL FITR DAY\r\n\r\nThe devotional acts on the ‘Id al-Fitr Day, the first of Shawwal, are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: It is recommended to say the supplicatory prayer that has been mentioned within the acts of the ‘Id al-Fitr Night to be said after the obligatory prayers and that begins with (AllahuakbarAllahu akbar) after the Fajr Prayer and after the ‘Id al-Fitr Prayer.\r\n\r\nSecond: It is recommended to say, after the Fajr Prayer, the supplicatory prayer, which begins with the following statement:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّىْ تَوَجَّهْتُ اِلَيْكَ‏ بِمُحَمَّدٍ اِمَامِىْ--This supplicatory prayer has been mentioned by Sayyid Ibn Tawus. However, Shaykh al-Tusi has mentioned that this prayer is said after the ‘Id al-Fitr Prayer (Salat al-’Id).\r\n\r\nThird: It is obligatory to defray Zakat al-Fitrah as a single sa’ (a measure) for each person before the time of the ‘Id al-Fitr Prayer with details shown in books of Muslim jurisprudence. It is worth mentioning that Zakat al-Fitrah is one of the confirmed obligations, since the acceptance of one’s fasting is dependent upon the defrayment of this alms. It is also security against death up to the next year. In the following verses of the Holy Qur’an, Almighty Allah has mentioned Zakat before the prayers:\r\n\r\n“He indeed shall be successful who pays Zakat, magnifies the name of his Lord, and prays. 87/14-15”\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to bathe oneself on this day. It is more preferable to bathe oneself in a river, if possible. In the word of Shaykh al-Tusi, the time of bathing is the period between dawn (fajr) and the ‘Id al-Fitr Prayer. According to a Hadith, when you want to bathe yourself (in a river), try to be under shadow or under a wall. When you intend to begin the bathing, you may say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِيْمَانًا بِكَ وَ تَصْدِيْقًا بِكِتَابِكَ وَ اتِّبَاعَ سُنَّةِ نَبِيِّكَ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ اٰلِهِ--You may then mention the Name of Almighty Allah and bathe yourself.\r\n\r\nAfter accomplishment, you may say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ كَفَّارَةً لِذُنُوْبِيْ وَ طَهِّرْ دِيْنِيْۤ اَللّٰهُمَّ اَذْهِبْ عَنِّيْ الدَّنَسَ۔--Fifth: It is recommended to put on the best clothes, apply perfumes, and offer the prayer in an open place, other than Holy Makkah.\r\n\r\nSixth: It is recommended to eat something, as a breaking of the fast, before the ‘Id al-Fitr Prayer. It is preferable to break the fast with some dates or a piece of candy. Shaykh al-Mufid has mentioned that it is advisable to swallow a piece of the soil of Imam al-Husayn’s tomb, for it is remedy for all illnesses.\r\n\r\nSeventh: It is recommended not to leave one’s house for joining the congregational ‘Id al-Fitr Prayer before sunrise. It is also recommended to say the supplicatory prayers that have been mentioned by Sayyid Ibn Tawus in Iqbal al-A’mal. Among these supplicatory prayers is the one that Abu-Hamzah al-Thumali has reported Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) as saying: Whey you ready yourself for joining the congregational Friday Prayers and the ‘Id Prayers, you may say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ مَنْ تَهَيَّاَ فِيْ هٰذَا الْيَوْمِ اَوْ تَعَبَّاَ اَوْ اَعَدَّ وَ اسْتَعَدَّ لِوِفَادَةٍ اِلٰى مَخْلُوْقٍ رَجَاۤءَ رِفْدِهِ وَ نَوَافِلِهِ وَ فَوَاضِلِهِ وَ عَطَايَاهُ فَاِنَّ اِلَيْكَ يَا سَيِّدِيْ تَهْيِئَتِيْ وَ تَعْبِئَتِيْ وَ اِعْدَادِيْ وَ اسْتِعْدَادِيْ رَجَاۤءَ رِفْدِكَ وَ جَوَاۤئِزِكَ وَ نَوَافِلِكَ وَ فَوَاضِلِكَ وَ فَضَاۤئِلِكَ وَ عَطَايَاكَ وَ قَدْ غَدَوْتُ اِلٰى عِيْدٍ مِنْ اَعْيَادِ اُمَّةِ نَبِيِّكَ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَوَاتُ اللّٰهِ عَلَيْهِ وَ عَلٰىۤ اٰلِهِ وَ لَمْ اَفِدْ اِلَيْكَ الْيَوْمَ بِعَمَلٍ صَالِحٍ اَثِقُ بِهِ قَدَّمْتُهُ وَ لَا تَوَجَّهْتُ بِمَخْلُوْقٍ اَمَّلْتُهُ وَ لٰكِنْ اَتَيْتُكَ خَاضِعًا مُقِرًّا بِذُنُوْبِيْ وَ اِسَاۤءَتِيْ اِلٰى نَفْسِيْ فَيَا عَظِيْمُ يَا عَظِيْمُ يَا عَظِيْمُ اِغْفِرْ لِيَ الْعَظِيْمَ مِنْ ذُنُوْبِيْ فَاِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوْبَ الْعِظَامَ اِلَّاۤ اَنْتَ يَا لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا ۤاَنْتَ يَاۤ اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔",
