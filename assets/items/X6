    "content": "Be it known to you that the first Friday night in Rajab is called Laylat al-Ragha’ib (Night of Desires). It is reported that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to practice a (recommendable) rite that brings about remarkable rewards at this night, which is a prayer with a special formula. As is mentioned by Sayyid Ibn Tawus in Iqbal al-A’mal and ‘Allamah al-Majlisi in Ijazat Bani-zohrah, the rewards of one who offers this prayer are (1) a great number of his sins are forgiven, (2) on the first night in the grave, Almighty Allah sends him the reward of this prayer in the form of a life form with happy mien and fluency to say to him, “Good tidings, darling! You have escaped all hardships.” The offerer of this prayer will then ask, “Who are you? Indeed, I have never seen such s good-looking face, I have never heard such fluent words, and I have never smelled such nice scent.” He will be answered, “I am the reward of the prayer you offered at so-and-so night in so-and-so month in so-and-so year at the town of so-and-so. I am here now to give you your due, entertain you in your loneliness, and save you from this cheerless situation. When the Trumpet shall be blown (declaring the Resurrection Day), I will cast a shadow over your head in the Resurrection Court. So, be happy, for you shall never be deprived of goodness.”\r\n\r\nThe description of this prayer, however, is as follows:\r\n\r\nOne should observe fasting on the first Thursday in Rajab. Between the Maghrib (sunset) and Isha’ (evening) Prayers, one should offer a twelve unit prayer each couple of which is separated by Taslim (i.e. the concluding part of a ritual prayer). In each unit, one should recite Surah al-Faatehah once, Surah al-Qadr three times, and Surah al-Tawheed twelve times. After accomplishing the prayer, one should repeat the following invocation of blessings seventy times:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ وَ عَلٰى اٰلِهِ۔--Then, one should prostrate himself and repeat this litany seventy times:\r\n\r\n--سُبُّوْحٌ قُدُّوْسٌ رَبُّ الْمَلَاۤئِكَةِ وَ الرُّوْحِ۔--Then, one should raise the head from prostration and repeat this supplicatory prayer seventy times:\r\n\r\n--رَبِّ اغْفِرْ وَ ارْحَمْ وَ تَجَاوَزْ عَمَّا تَعْلَمُ اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ الْعَلِيُّ الْاَعْظَمُ۔--One should then prostrate himself again and repeat the same litany seventy times:\r\n\r\n--سُبُّوْحٌ قُدُّوْسٌ رَبُّ الْمَلَاۤئِكَةِ وَ الرُّوْحِ۔--Then, one may pray Almighty Allah for granting one’s needs, for they will be surely granted, God willing.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is highly advisable to visit the Holy Shrine of Imam al-Rida(a.s.) in Rajab, since it enjoys a special rank in this month. Similarly, to go on ‘Umrah in Rajab also brings about a great reward. In this respect, it has been narrated that ‘Umrah comes directly after the ritual Hajj in the amount of rewarding. Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-’Abidin(a.s.) is also reported to have gone on ‘Umrah in Rabaj. In addition to offering prayers near the Holy Ka’bah, the Imam (a.s.) used to prostrate himself before Almighty Allah too much, day and night, and used to say the following words while prostrating:\r\n\r\n--عَظُمَ الذَّنْبُ مِنْ عَبْدِكَ فَلْيَحْسُنِ الْعَفْوُ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ۔",
