The best area in this mosque is Masjid al-Rawzah, which is situated between the holy tomb and the minbar.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that our master scholar, in al-Tahiyyah, says that the areas where the bodies of the Holy Prophet and the Holy Imams (‘a) are buried are more honorable than the Holy Ka’bah. This fact has been unanimously adopted by all scholars, as is stated by al-Shahid al-Awwal (the First Martyr) in his book entitled al-Qawa’id wal-Fawa’id.\r\n\r\nAccording to an acceptable narration, al-Hazrami has reported that Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) instructed him to offer prayers, as many as he can, at the Holy Prophet’s Mosque, adding, “You do not always have the opportunity to present yourself in this holy area etc.”\r\n\r\nIn Tahdhib al-Ahkam, Shaykh al-Tusi, through a considerable chain of authority, has reported on the authority of Murazim that Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) said, “To observe fasting at al-Madinah and to perform acts of worship at the Pillars of the Holy Prophet’s Mosque are not obligatory. Rather, one who wills may observe fasting, for it is verily beneficial for him. What is obligatory among these acts are only the five daily prayers and the observance of fasting during the month of Ramazan. You are recommended to offer prayers as many as possible in this mosque, for this is for your good. Be aware that one who does a worldly job perfectly wins the praise of people. What will then be the reward of him who does a religious job perfectly?!”\r\n\r\nAs much as you can, you are recommended to visit the tombs of the Holy Prophet and Imams (‘a) at al-Baqi’ Cemetery every day. Whenever your sight falls on his chamber, invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon the Holy Prophet (s). As long as you are at al-Madinah, watch yourself against committing any ill deed and save yourself from acts of disobedience to Almighty Allah and wrongdoings. Besides, ponder over the honor of this city in general and the Holy Prophet’s Mosque in particular, for these places are the footsteps of the Holy Prophet (s) who frequently walked in the streets and marketplaces of this city and offered prayers in its mosques. They are also the places of the Divine Revelation where Archangel Gabriel, as well as the Archangels, used to visit.\r\n\r\nExcellent is the poet who composed this poetic verse in this respect:\r\n\r\n--اَرْضٌ مَشٰى جِبْرِيْلُ فِيْ عَرَصَاتِهَا وَ اللّٰهُ شَرَّفَ اَرْضَهَا وَ سَمَاۤءَهَا۔--You are also recommended to give alms, especially to Sayyids and to the descendants of the Holy Prophet (s), as much as you can at al-Madinah in general and at the Holy Prophet’s Mosque in particular, for this act brings about enormous rewards and great returns.\r\n\r\n‘Allamah al-Majlisi, according to an authorized narration, said, “A single dirham (i.e. a silver old currency) that is given as alms at al-Madinah is equal (in reward) to ten thousand dirhams that are given as alms at other places.”\r\n\r\nYou are also recommended to keep yourself in the vicinity of this holy city, for numerous narrations have referred to the merits of staying at al-Madinah.\r\n\r\nA poet says,\r\n\r\n--سَقَى اللّٰهُ قَبْرًا بِالْمَدِيْنَةِ غَيْثَهُ فَقَدْ حَلَّ فِيْهِ الْاَمْنُ بِالْبَرَكَاتِ نَبِيُّ الْهُدٰى صَلّٰى عَلَيْهِ مَلِيْكُهُ وَ بَلَّغَ عَنَّا رُوْحَهُ التُّحَفَاتِ وَ صَلّٰى عَلَيْهِ اللّٰهُ مَا ذَرَّ شَارِقٌ وَ لَاحَتْ نُجُوْمُ اللَّيْلِ مُبْتَدِرَاتِ",
