    "content": "It is worth mentioning that it is highly recommended to offer many (mustahab / nafilah) prayers at Friday nights such as Imam Ali’s Prayer, known as (Salat Ameer al-Momineen) and the two-unit prayer in each of which one should recite Surah al-Faatehah once and repeat Surah al-Zalzalah (No. 99) fifteen times. It has been narrated that one who offers this prayer will be saved, by Almighty Allah, from the grave torment and the horrors on the Resurrection Day.\r\n\r\nThird: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Jumu’ah (No. 62) in the first unit of the Maghrib (Sunset) and Isha’ (Evening) obligatory Prayers, and to recite Surah al-Tawheed (No. 112) in the second unit of the Maghrib Prayer and Surah al-A’la (No. 87) in the second unit of the Isha’ Prayer.\r\n\r\nFourth: It is highly recommended to avoid reciting poetry at Friday nights. Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) is authentically reported to have said that it is abominable to say poetry for one observing fasting (sawm), the Muhrim (entering into Ihram: putting the pilgrimage uniform and entering the state of being performing the obligatory rites of the ritual Hajj), and on Fridays and at Friday nights. When he was asked whether this instruction is effective on the religiously acceptable poetry too, the Imam (a.s.) answered affirmatively.\r\n\r\nIt has been also authentically narrated on the authority of Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said, “One who utters even one verse of poetry on Fridays and at Friday nights will have nothing of the rewards except that of uttering that poetry.”\r\n\r\nAccording to another narration, the prayers of those who recite poetry on Fridays will not be accepted.\r\n\r\nFifth: It is highly recommended to pray Almighty Allah for the good of one’s brethren-in-faith very frequently so as to copy the deed of Lady Fatimah al-Zahra’. According to a Hadith, one who prays for ten deceased individuals will be unquestionably allowed to enter Paradise.\r\n\r\nSixth: It is also recommended to say the supplications dedicated to Fridays. Actually, these supplications are too numerous to be cited in this chapter; therefore, a few of them will be hereinafter mentioned:",
