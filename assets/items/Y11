As a sufficient merit, these narrations have been reported through several valid chains of authority from Imam Zayn al-’Abidin and Imam al-Sadiq as saying, “He who would like to be shaken hands by one hundred thousand and twenty-four prophets, may visit the tomb of Abu-’Abdullah al-Husayn on the fifteenth of Sha’ban, because the spirits of the prophets ask Almighty Allah to permit them to visit Imam al-Husayn’s tomb and the Almighty gives them permission. So, blessed be the one who shakes hands with these prophets among whom is the five constancy-endowed Messengers; namely, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all.”\r\n\r\nWhen the reporter asked the Imam (‘a) to explain the meaning of constancy-endowed, the Imam (‘a) answered, “These prophets were sent to the east and west of the globe and to both humankind and jinn.”\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of visiting the holy tomb of Imam al-Husayn (‘a) on the fifteenth of Sha’ban. The first form is the same as the one previously cited for ziyarah on the first of Rajab, and the second is as follows:\r\n\r\nIn his book of al-Balad al-Amin, Shaykh al-Kaf’ami has reported Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) as saying that one who visits Imam al-Husayn’s tomb on the fifteenth of Sha’ban may stop at the tomb and say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيْمِ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الْعَبْدُ الصَّالِحُ الزَّكِيُّ اُوْدِعُكَ شَهَادَةً مِنِّيْ لَكَ تُقَرِّبُنِيْ اِلَيْكَ فِيْ يَوْمِ شَفَاعَتِكَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قُتِلْتَ وَ لَمْ تَمُتْ بَلْ بِرَجَاۤءِ حَيَاتِكَ حَيِيَتْ قُلُوْبُ شِيْعَتِكَ وَ بِضِيَاۤءِ نُوْرِكَ اهْتَدَى الطَّالِبُوْنَ اِلَيْكَ وَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ نُوْرُ اللّٰهِ الَّذِيْ لَمْ يُطْفَأْ وَ لَا يُطْفَاُ اَبَدًا وَ اَنَّكَ وَجْهُ اللّٰهِ الَّذِيْ لَمْ يَهْلِكْ وَ لَا يُهْلَكُ اَبَدًا وَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ هٰذِهِ التُّرْبَةَ تُرْبَتُكَ وَ هٰذَا الْحَرَمَ حَرَمُكَ وَ هٰذَا الْمَصْرَعَ مَصْرَعُ بَدَنِكَ لَا ذَلِيْلَ وَ اللّٰهِ مُعِزُّكَ وَ لَا مَغْلُوْبَ وَ اللّٰهِ نَاصِرُكَ هٰذِهِ شَهَادَةٌ لِيْ عِنْدَكَ اِلٰى يَوْمِ قَبْضِ رُوْحِيْ بِحَضْرَتِكَ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ۔",

Peace be upon you, O righteous, pure servant (of Allah). I entrust with you a testimony of mine that takes me near you on the day of your intercession (for some people). I bear witness that although you were slain, you have not died; rather, the hearts of your adherents (Shi'ah) are living on the hope of your being alive, and by the light of your illumination have your seekers been guided (to the right path). I also bear witness that you are verily the Light of Allah that has not and shall never be extinguished and you are verily the Face of Allah that has not and shall never be perishing. I also bear witness that this soil is yours, this holy precinct is yours, and this death is the death of your body only, while you have never been humiliated since Allah is the One Who is pouring honor upon you and you have never been defeated since Allah is the One Who is supporting you. I would like you to keep this testimony of mine with you up to the day when my soul will be grasped in the presence of you. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you."
