    "content": "From many Qur’anic verses and traditions, we can conclude that a Muslim individual is required to steer clear of showing love, sharing mutual affection, and inclining towards the nonbelievers as well as assimilating himself/herself to them and following their ways. In this respect, Allah the All-exalted says (in the Holy Qur’an):\r\n\r\n--قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ اُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِىْۤ اِبْرٰهِيْمَ وَالَّذِيْنَ مَعَهُ اِذْ قَالُوْا لِقَوْمِهِمْ اِنَّا بُرَءَاۤؤُ مِنْكُمْ وَ مِمَّا تَعْبُدُوْنَ مِنْ دُوْنِ اللّٰهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَ بَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَ بَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةُ وَالْبَغْضَاۤءُ اَبَدًا۔--Shaykh al-Saduq has reported Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) as saying, “Almighty Allah inspired to one of His prophets to convey this message to the believers: Do not dress yourselves with the costumes of My enemies, do not eat what they eat, and do not behave like them; lest, you will be My enemies as they are.”\r\n\r\nIn view of that, traditions have forbidden from certain acts for no reason more than avoiding imitating the nonbelievers.",
