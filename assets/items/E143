Verily, Almighty Allah will relieve one who does so from grievances. The supplication is as follows:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْۤ اَتَوَجَّهُ اِلَيْكَ بِاَحَبِّ الْاَسْمَاۤءِ اِلَيْكَ وَ اَعْظَمِهَا لَدَيْكَ وَ اَتَقَرَّبُ وَ اَتَوَسَّلُ اِلَيْكَ بِمَنْ اَوْجَبْتَ حَقَّهُ عَلَيْكَ وَ بِمُحَمَّدٍ وَ عَلِيٍّ وَ فَاطِمَةَ وَ الْحَسَنِ وَ الْحُسَيْنِ وَ عَلِيِّ بْنِ الْحُسَيْنِ وَ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ وَ جَعْفَرِ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ مُوْسَى بْنِ جَعْفَرٍ وَ عَلِيِّ بْنِ مُوْسٰى وَ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ وَ عَلِيِّ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ الْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ وَ الْحُجَّةِ الْمُنْتَظَرِ صَلَوَاتُ اللّٰهِ عَلَيْهِمْ اَجْمَعِيْنَ اِكْفِنِي۔۔۔۔--You may then mention your need.",
