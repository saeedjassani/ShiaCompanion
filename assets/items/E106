So, please teach me some words by which Almighty Allah will benefit me and make them as easy as possible for me.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) asked the man to repeat his request three times. Then the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) answered, “All trees and rocks around you have wept for you out of mercy. When you accomplish the dawn (fajr) Prayer, you may repeat the following doxology (zikr) ten times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ الْعَظِيْمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظيْمِ۔--If you say so, Allah, the Almighty and Majestic, will save you from blindness, lunacy, leprosy, poverty, and senility.”\r\n\r\nThe man said, “This was for worldly affairs; what do you have for me for the Hereafter?”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said, “You may say the following supplicatory prayer after accomplishing every prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اهْدِنِىْ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ وَاَفِضْ عَلَىَّ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ وَانْشُرْ عَلَىَّ مِنْ رَحْمَتِكَ وَاَنْزِلْ عَلَىَّ مِنْ بَرَكَاتِكَ۔--If this man comes on the Resurrection Day abiding by these supplicatory prayers without neglecting them deliberately, all the eight gates of Paradise will be opened before him so that he can enter from any gate he wishes.”\r\n\r\nHowever, according to another tradition that is reported through valid chains of authority, a different supplicatory prayer has been mentioned.",
