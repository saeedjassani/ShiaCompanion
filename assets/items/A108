The Holy Prophet (S) said that the reward for reciting this Surah can be compared to ten times the number of disbelievers who were present in Makkah.\r\n\r\nReciting Surah al-Humazah in compulsory prayers keeps a person safe from poverty. Sustenance comes towards him. His death will not be of a sudden and terrifying nature. This Surah is also a cure for pain in the eyes and should be recited before blowing gently into the eyes for relief from pain. Keeping this Surah in a talisman around one’s neck acts as a protection from the ‘evil eye’.\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ--وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةِ ۙ‏(1)--اۨلَّذِىْ جَمَعَ مَالًا وَّعَدَّدَهٗ ۙ‏(2)--يَحْسَبُ اَنَّ مَالَهٗۤ اَخْلَدَهٗ‌ ۚ‏(3)--كَلَّا‌ لَيُنْۢبَذَنَّ فِى الْحُطَمَةِ ۖ‏(4)--وَمَاۤ اَدْرٰٮكَ مَا الْحُطَمَةُ ؕ‏(5)--نَارُ اللّٰهِ الْمُوْقَدَةُ ۙ‏(6)--الَّتِىْ تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى الْاَفْئِدَةِ ؕ‏(7)--اِنَّهَا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّؤْصَدَةٌ ۙ‏(8)--فِىْ عَمَدٍ مُّمَدَّدَةٍ‏(9)",
