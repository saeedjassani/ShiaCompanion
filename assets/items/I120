The enshrouding person may spread out the fifth piece of cloth, put a little quantity of cotton over it, disperse a little quantity of crumbs (of either the leaves of lote-tree or powdered incense) over it, put some of the crumbs on the two private parts of the dead person, and stuff the anus with little cotton. Then, the buttocks and the thighs must be tied up firmly with the (fifth) piece of cloth. Then, the apron must be tied up from the navel downwards. Then, the dead body must be dressed the shirt over which the wrapper is dressed and over it the special wrap, or the other piece of clothes that replaces it, must be dressed.\r\n\r\nWith the dead body, two palm-leaf stalks, or stalks of any other tree, must be put. These two stalks must be wet and must be in the size of the arm bone. One of the stalks must be put to the right side of the dead body and stuck to the skin near the loin. The other stalk must be put to the left side between the shirt and the apron. The organs of prostration (i.e. the forehead, the palms of the hands, the knees, and the fingers of the feet) must be stained with camphor. If any amount of camphor remains, it must be put on the chest. Then, the wrapper must be restored to its position and knotted from the sides of the head and the feet. When the dead body is buried, these knots must be unfastened. Then, the dead body must be carried on the bedstead to the prayer-place, where the ritual prayer of the deceased is performed.",
