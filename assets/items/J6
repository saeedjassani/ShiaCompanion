    "content": "Too many are the recommended rites on Fridays; yet, we will briefly mention the following:\r\n\r\nFirst: In the first unit of the dawn (fajr) Prayer, it is recommended to recite Surah al-Jumu’ah (No. 62) and, in the second unit, Surah al-Tawheed (No. 112).\r\n\r\nSecond: Before opening the mouth with any word, it is recommended to say the following supplicatory prayer after the dawn (fajr) Prayer so that all sins committed throughout the week will be forgiven:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ مَا قُلْتُ فِي جُمُعَتِيْ هٰذِهِ مِنْ قَوْلٍ اَوْ حَلَفْتُ فِيْهَا مِنْ حَلْفٍ اَوْ نَذَرْتُ فِيْهَا مِنْ نَذْرٍ فَمَشِيَّتُكَ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ ذٰلِكَ كُلِّهِ فَمَا شِئْتَ مِنْهُ اَنْ يَّكُوْنَ كَانَ وَ مَا لَمْ تَشَأْ مِنْهُ لَمْ يَكُنِ اللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِيْ وَ تَجَاوَزْ عَنِّي اَللّٰهُمَّ مَنْ صَلَّيْتَ عَلَيْهِ فَصَلَوَاتِي عَلَيْهِ وَ مَنْ لَعَنْتَ فَلَعْنَتِيْ عَلَيْهِ۔--This act should be done once a month at least.\r\n\r\nIt has been also narrated that one who, after the accomplishment of the dawn (fajr) Prayer on Fridays, does devotional acts and says supplications and invocations until sunrise will be raised seventy ranks to the Supreme Paradise.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Tusi has recorded that it is highly recommended to say the following supplicatory prayer after the dawn (fajr) Prayer on Fridays:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّي تَعَمَّدْتُ اِلَيْكَ بِحَاجَتِي وَ اَنْزَلْتُ اِلَيْكَ الْيَوْمَ فَقْرِيْ وَ فَاقَتِيْ وَ مَسْكَنَتِيْ فَاَنَا لِمَغْفِرَتِكَ اَرْجٰى مِنِّي لِعَمَلِيْ وَ لِمَغْفِرَتُكَ وَ رَحْمَتُكَ اَوْسَعُ مِنْ ذُنُوْبِيْ فَتَوَلَّ قَضَاۤءَ كُلِّ حَاجَةٍ لِيْ بِقُدْرَتِكَ عَلَيْهَا وَ تَيْسِيْرِ [تَيَسُّرِ] ذٰلِكَ عَلَيْكَ وَ لِفَقْرِيْ اِلَيْكَ فَاِنِّي لَمْ اُصِبْ خَيْرًا قَطُّ اِلَّا مِنْكَ وَ لَمْ يَصْرِفْ عَنِّي سُوۤءًا قَطُّ اَحَدٌ سِوَاكَ وَ لَسْتُ [لَيْسَ‏] اَرْجُوۤ لِاٰخِرَتِي وَ دُنْيَايَ وَ لَا لِيَوْمِ فَقْرِيْ يَوْمَ يُفْرِدُنِي النَّاسُ فِي حُفْرَتِيْ وَ اُفْضِيْ اِلَيْكَ بِذَنْبِيْ سِوَاكَ۔--Third: It has been narrated that one who says the following invocation after the Zohr and Fajr Prayers on Fridays, as well as other days, will catch Imam al-Mahdi(a.s.) before he dies:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ عَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ۔--In addition, it has been narrated that one who repeats the aforesaid invocation one hundred times will have sixty of his requests granted for him - thirty in this worldly life and thirty on the Resurrection Day.\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Rahman (No. 55) after the Fajr Prayer on Fridays and to say, “None of Your favors do I deny,”  wherever the verses, “Then which of the favors of your Lord will ye deny?” are recited.\r\n\r\nFifth: Shaykh al-Tusi has recorded that it is highly recommended to recite Surah al-Tawheed, to invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon Muhammad and his Household, and to pray Him for forgiveness each one hundred times after the Fajr Prayer on Fridays. It is also highly recommended to recite Surahs al-Nisa’ (No. 4), Hud (No. 11), al-Kahf (No. 18), al-Saaffaat (No. 37), and al-Rahman (No. 55) during that time.\r\n\r\nSixth: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Ahqaf (No. 46) and Surah al-Mu’minun (No. 23).\r\n\r\nImam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported as saying that anyone who recites Surah al-Ahqaf at Friday nights or on Fridays will not be inflicted by dismays in his worldly life and will be saved from the horrors on the Resurrection Day. The Imam (a.s.) is also reported as saying that anyone who recites Surah al-Mu’minun regularly each Friday will come upon a happy end and will be granted an abode in the Supreme Paradise with the Prophets and Messengers of Almighty Allah.\r\n\r\nSeventh: It is recommended to repeat Surah al-Kafirun (No. 109) ten times before sunrise and then pray Almighty Allah so that all prayers will be answered.\r\n\r\nIt has been narrated that Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-’Abidin (a.s.) used to repeat reciting Ayah al-Kursi (verse No. 255 of Surah al-Baqarah No. 2) from early morning up to midday (zohr) on Fridays. When he accomplished the obligatory prayers, he would recite Surah al-Qadr (No. 97) frequently.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that to recite Ayah al-Kursi in the form of revelation  on Fridays achieves a great reward.\r\n\r\nEighth: It is highly recommended to bathe oneself. In fact, this is one of the most confirmed rituals of Fridays. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is reported to have instructed Imam Ali(a.s.) by saying, “O Ali; wash yourself every Friday even if you have to purchase water with your Daily provisions and have nothing to eat. Verily, no voluntary act is better than this.”\r\n\r\nImam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is also reported to have said: Whoever washes himself on Fridays and, meanwhile, says the following supplicatory prayer will be pure all through that week:\r\n\r\n--اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهُ وَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَ رَسُوْلُهُ اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اجْعَلْنِيْ مِنَ التَّوَّابِيْنَ وَ اجْعَلْنِيْ مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِيْنَ۔--“Pure” in the aforesaid Hadith stands for purification from sins or acceptance of the deeds, which is thus moral purification.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is important not to neglect bathing oneself on Fridays when possible. The recommended time of this bathing is between sunrise and midday (zohr). In addition, the nearer to midday (zohr) the better.\r\n\r\nNinth: It is recommended to dye with hibiscus, for it saves from leprosy and insanity.\r\n\r\nTenth: It is also recommended to cut the mustache neatly and trim the nails so as not to miss the great merits of doing these acts. As has been mentioned in narrations, these acts bring about expansion in sustenance, cancellation of sins up to the next Friday, and security from insanity and leprosy. On doing that, it is recommended to say the following litany:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ وَ بِاللّٰهِ وَ عَلٰى سُنَّةِ مُحَمَّدٍ [رَسُوْلِ اللّٰهِ ‏] وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ۔--It is also recommended, on cutting the nails, to start with the little finger of the left hand and end with that of the right hand. The same thing is applicable to the nails of the feet. Then, the cut nails should be buried.\r\n\r\nEleventh: It is recommended to apply perfume and put on the best of one’s clothes.\r\n\r\nTwelfth: It is recommended to give alms, for the rewards are doubled up on Fridays and at Friday nights, as is confirmed by narrations, as one thousand folds as giving alms on other days.\r\n\r\nThirteenth: It is recommended to arrange fruits and wholesome meals to the family members so that Fridays will be their days of pleasure.\r\n\r\nFourteenth: It is recommended to eat pomegranate before breakfast and to eat seven leaves of endive before midday (zohr). In this connection, Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.) is reported to have said, “The heart of him who eats a pomegranate before breakfast on Fridays will be enlightened for forty days. To eat two pomegranates increases the period of enlightenment to eighty days, and so on. It also dismisses the evil suggestions. Of course, to get rid of Satan’s suggestions is to stop acting disobediently to Almighty Allah; and to stop acting disobediently to Him allows entrance to Paradise.”\r\n\r\nIn al-Misbah, the author has said that to eat pomegranates on Fridays and at Friday nights achieves great merits.\r\n\r\nFifteenth: It is recommended to dedicate Fridays to learning the religious laws and instructions, not to wandering in others’ gardens, accompanying the vicious and the licentious, speaking about the others’ defects, laughing and guffawing, reciting poetry, and discussing useless subjects as well as similar matters. Disadvantages arisen from such matters are too many to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nImam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported as saying, “Woe to a Muslim who does not dedicate Fridays to learning the affairs of his religion.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is also reported to have said, “If you, on Fridays, see old men telling the tales of infidelity and of the pre-Islamic era, you should then make their heads the targets of stones.”\r\n\r\nSixteenth: It is recommended to repeat one thousand times at least the invocation of blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household. Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) is reported to have said, “For me, no act of worship is more favorable than invoking blessings upon the Prophet and his immaculate Household - may Allah bless them all - on Fridays.”\r\n\r\nIf there is not enough time to repeat this invocation one thousand times, it must be repeated one hundred times at least so that faces will be brightened on the Judgement Day.\r\n\r\nIt has been also narrated that all sins will be totally forgiven for those who repeat invocations of blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household one hundred times, repeat the following supplicatory prayer one hundred times, and recite Surah al-Tawheed (No. 112) one hundred times on Fridays:\r\n\r\n--اَستَغفِرُاللهَ رَبِّی وَ اَتُوْبُ اِلَیْهِ۔--It has been also narrated that to invoke blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his household is equal (in reward) to seventy times of going on Hajj.\r\n\r\nSeventeenth: It is recommended to say the ritual Ziyarahs of the Holy Prophet and Imams, peace be upon them all. A section of this book is dedicated to the etiquettes and methods of Ziyarahs.\r\n\r\nEighteenth: It is recommended to visit the tombs of one’s relatives in general and parents in particular. Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) is reported as saying, “Visit the graves of your relatives on Fridays, for they know about those who visit their graves and will be happy for that.”\r\n\r\nNineteenth: It is recommended to say Dua al-Nudbah Supplication, which is one of the rites to be done on the Four Feast Days (i.e. ‘Id al-Fitr - the first of Shawwal, ‘Id al-Adha - the tenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, ‘Id al-Ghadir - the eighteenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, and Fridays).",

Verily, I hope for Your forgiveness more than I rely on my deeds. Indeed, Your forgiveness and Your mercy are more inclusive than my sins are. So, (please) embark on settling all my needs out of Your power over them, out of the easiness for You to do that, and out of my urgent need for that. Verily, I have not gained any good thing save from You and none could ever repel evil from me save You. I hope for none to stand for me in my affairs of this world and the Next World and on the day of my poverty, when people will leave me alone in my hole * (i.e. grave) and I will then confess of my sins before You, except You. \r\n\r\nThird: It has been narrated that one who says the following invocation after the Zohr and Fajr Prayers on Fridays, as well as other days, will catch Imam al-Mahdi (a.s.) before he dies:\r\n\r\nO Allah, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and hasten their Relief. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it has been narrated that one who repeats the aforesaid invocation one hundred times will have sixty of his requests granted for him - thirty in this worldly life and thirty on the Resurrection Day.\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Rahman (No. 55) after the Fajr Prayer on Fridays and to say, “None of Your favors do I deny,”1 wherever the verses, “Then which of the favors of your Lord will ye deny?” are recited.\r\n\r\nFifth: Shaykh al-Tusi has recorded that it is highly recommended to recite Surah al-Tawheed, to invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon Muhammad and his Household, and to pray Him for forgiveness each one hundred times after the Fajr Prayer on Fridays.
