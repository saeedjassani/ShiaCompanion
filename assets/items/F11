    "content": "Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer is as precious as gold, since it is the most magnificent recommended devotional rite. Altogether with its great merits the most important of which is that it erases major sins, this prayer has been reported through authenticated chain of authority. The best time of its performance is the first hours of daylight on Fridays. It consists of four units with two Tashahhuds (i.e. the part of prayers in which the two creeds of Islam are recited) and two Taslims. In the first unit, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Zalzalah are recited, in the second, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-’Adiyat, in the third, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Nasr, and in the fourth, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Tawheed. In each unit, after the recitation of the Surahs and before the genuflection (ruku'), the following litany (Tasbihat) should be repeated fifteen times:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ وَ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَ اللهُ اَكْبَرُ۔--The same litany (Tasbihat) is repeated, yet ten times only, during the Ruku’, after the Ruku’ while standing erect, during the prostration (Sujud), after the first Sajdah, during the second Sajdah, and after the second Sajdah. The same thing is repeated in all of the four units of the prayer. Hence, the litany will have been repeated three hundred times.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Kulayni has narrated that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said to Abu-Sa’id al-Mada’ini, “May I teach you something that you should recite in Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer?” As the man answered in the affirmative, the Imam (a.s.) said: After you say the Tasbihat in the second Sajdah of the fourth unit, say the following litany:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَ مَنْ لَبِسَ الْعِزَّ وَ الْوَقَارَ سُبْحَانَ مَنْ تَعَطَّفَ بِالْمَجْدِ وَ تَكَرَّمَ بِهِ سُبْحَانَ مَنْ لَا يَنْبَغِيْ التَّسْبِيْحُ اِلَّا لَهُ سُبْحَانَ مَنْ اَحْصٰى كُلَّ شَيْ‏ءٍ عِلْمُهُ سُبْحَانَ ذِي الْمَنِّ وَ النِّعَمِ سُبْحَانَ ذِي الْقُدْرَةِ وَ الْكَرَمِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّي اَسْاَلُكَ بِمَعَاقِدِ الْعِزِّ مِنْ عَرْشِكَ وَ مُنْتَهَى الرَّحْمَةِ مِنْ كِتَابِكَ وَ اسْمِكَ الْاَعْظَمِ وَ كَلِمَاتِكَ التَّآمَّةِ الَّتِي تَمَّتْ صِدْقًا وَ عَدْلًا صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَ افْعَلْ بِيْ كَذَا وَ كَذَا۔--Then, you may mention your needs in the form of supplication.\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Tusi and Sayyid Ibn Tawus both narrated that al-Mufaddal ibn ‘Umar said that he heard Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) saying the following supplicatory prayer after accomplishing Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer:\r\n\r\n--«يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ»--Say it as many times as possible in one breath.\r\n\r\n--«يَا رَبَّاهُ يَا رَبَّاهُ»--Say it as many times as possible in one breath.\r\n\r\n--«رَبِّ رَبِّ»--Say it as many times as possible in one breath.\r\n\r\n--«يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ»--Say it as many times as possible in one breath.\r\n\r\n--«يَا حَىُّ يَا حَىُّ»--Say it as many times as possible in one breath.\r\n\r\n--«يَا رَحِيْمُ يَا رَحِيْمُ»--Say it as many times as possible in one breath.\r\n\r\n--«يَا رَحْمٰنُ يَا رَحْمٰنُ»--Repeat it seven times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ»--Repeat it seven times.\r\n\r\nThen, say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْ اَفْتَتِحُ الْقَوْلَ بِحَمْدِكَ وَ اَنْطِقُ بِالثَّنَاۤءِ عَلَيْكَ وَ اُمَجِّدُكَ وَ لَا غَايَةَ لِمَدْحِكَ وَ اُثْنِيْ عَلَيْكَ وَ مَنْ يَبْلُغُ غَايَةَ ثَنَاۤئِكَ وَ اَمَدَ مَجْدِكَ وَ اَنَّى لِخَلِيْقَتِكَ كُنْهُ مَعْرِفَةِ مَجْدِكَ وَ اَيَّ زَمَنٍ لَمْ تَكُنْ مَمْدُوْحًا بِفَضْلِكَ مَوْصُوْفًا بِمَجْدِكَ عَوَّادًا عَلَى الْمُذْنِبِيْنَ بِحِلْمِكَ تَخَلَّفَ سُكَّانُ اَرْضِكَ عَنْ طَاعَتِكَ فَكُنْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَطُوْفًا بِجُوْدِكَ جَوَادًا بِفَضْلِكَ عَوَّادًا بِكَرَمِكَ يَا لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ الْمَنَّانُ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَ الْاِكْرَامِ۔--Al-Mufaddal then added: Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) then said to me, “If you have a significant request and you want it to be granted, you may offer this prayer, say this supplication, and implore Almighty Allah to respond to you. If you do, it will be granted, Allah willing.”\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Tusi has narrated that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) recommended the following supplicatory prayer for having one’s requests granted:\r\n\r\nObserve fasting on consecutive Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. At Thursday evening, give half bushel of food for ten poor people as alms. On Friday, wash yourself and go out to a wasteland and offer therein Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer sticking your knees to the ground after you uncover them. You may then say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--يَا مَنْ اَظْهَرَ الْجَمِيْلَ وَ سَتَرَ [عَلَيَ‏] الْقَبِيْحَ يَا مَنْ لَمْ يُؤَاخِذْ بِالْجَرِيْرَةِ وَ لَمْ يَهْتِكِ السِّتْرَ يَا عَظِيْمَ الْعَفْوِ يَا حَسَنَ التَّجَاوُزِ يَا وَاسِعَ الْمَغْفِرَةِ يَا بَاسِطَ الْيَدَيْنِ بِالرَّحْمَةِ يَا صَاحِبَ كُلِّ نَجْوٰى وَ مُنْتَهٰى كُلِّ شَكْوٰى يَا مُقِيْلَ الْعَثَرَاتِ يَا كَرِيْمَ الصَّفْحِ يَا عَظِيْمَ الْمَنِّ يَا مُبْتَدِئًا بِالنِّعَمِ قَبْلَ اسْتِحْقَاقِهَا يَا رَبَّاهُ يَا رَبَّاهُ يَا رَبَّاهُ،--Repeat this statement ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ‏»--Repeat it ten times, too.\r\n\r\n--«يَا سَیِّدَاهُ يَا سَيِّدَاهُ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا مَوْلَايَاهُ،يَا مَوْلَايَاهُ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا رَجَاۤءَاهُ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا غِيَاثَاهُ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا غَايَةَ رَغَبَتَاهُ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا رَحْمٰنُ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا رَحِيْمُ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«يَا مُعْطِىَ الْخَيْرَاتِ»--Repeat it ten times.\r\n\r\n--«صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَثِيْرًا طَيِّبًا كَاَفْضَلِ مَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلٰى اَحَدٍ مِنْ خَلْقِكَ»--You may then mention your requests.\r\n\r\nMany narrations have mentioned emphatically fasting on these three days and then performance of a two-unit prayer at midday (zohr) on Friday so that one’s requests are granted.",
