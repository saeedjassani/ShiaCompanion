    "content": "Three rites are dedicated to the thirteenth night of Ramadan, which is the first of the Illuminated Nights:\r\n\r\nFIRST: It is recommended to bathe oneself at this night.\r\n\r\nSECOND: It is recommended to offer a four-unit prayer and to recite at each unit Surah al-Faatehah once and Surah al-Tawheed twenty-five times.\r\n\r\nTHIRD: It is recommended to offer a two-unit prayer just like the prayer that is decided to the thirteenth nights of Rajab and Shaâ€™ban. In this prayer, it is recommended to recite Surahs al-Faatehah, Yasin, al-Mulk, and al-Tawheed.\r\n\r\nTHE 14TH NIGHT OF RAMADAN\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to offer at this night a prayer consisting of four units, each two alone. This prayer is similar to the previous one. As has been previously mentioned, if one says the famous supplicatory prayer known as DUA AL-MUJEER on the Illuminated Days of Ramadan (i.e. 13th, 14th & 15th), all his sins will be forgiven even if they are as many as rain drops, tree leaves, and desert pebbles.",
