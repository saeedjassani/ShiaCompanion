    "content": "Actually, I could not put my hand on an authentically reported form of ziyarah that is dedicated to the holy prophets, except for two forms of ziyarah of Prophet Adam and Prophet Noah, which have been previously cited within the forms of ziyarah of Imam ‘Ali Amir al-Mu’minin (‘a).\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the first comprehensive form of ziyarah (al-Ziyarah al-Jami’ah al-Saghirah) can be said at visiting the tombs of the holy prophets, too, as is inferred from its report. Confirming this fact, the sublime Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Mashhadi and the magnificent Sayyid Ibn Tawus, in the book of Misbah al-Za’ir as well as other books, have mentioned this form of ziyarah to be said at visiting the shrine of Prophet Jonah within the etiquettes of entering the city of al-Kufah. Most probably, these scholars have mentioned this comprehensive form of ziyarah for visiting this shrine is only because of the generality that is understood from the narration of this form of ziyarah. In other words, the report of this form of ziyarah suggests that it can be said at all shrines.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it is appropriate to say al-Ziyarah al-Jami’ah al-Saghirah, which has been previously cited in this book, when visiting the shrines of the holy prophets.",
