Abu’l-Qasim ibn ‘Ala’ al-HaMadani, the representative of Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari(a.s.), received a document telling that our master, Imam al-Husayn ibn Ali(a.s.), was born on the third of Sha’ban; therefore, you should observe fasting on this day and say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْۤ اَسْاَلُكَ بِحَقِّ الْمَوْلُوْدِ فِيْ هٰذَا الْيَوْمِ الْمَوْعُوْدِ بِشَهَادَتِهِ قَبْلَ اسْتِهْلَالِهِ وَ وِلَادَتِهِ بَكَتْهُ السَّمَاۤءُ وَ مَنْ فِيْهَا وَ الْاَرْضُ وَ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا وَ لَمَّا يَطَأْ لَابَتَيْهَا قَتِيْلِ الْعَبْرَةِ وَ سَيِّدِ الْاُسْرَةِ الْمَمْدُوْدِ بِالنُّصْرَةِ يَوْمَ الْكَرَّةِ الْمُعَوَّضِ مِنْ قَتْلِهِ اَنَّ الْاَئِمَّةَ مِنْ نَسْلِهِ وَ الشِّفَاۤءَ فِيْ تُرْبَتِهِ وَ الْفَوْزَ مَعَهُ فِيْۤ اَوْبَتِهِ وَ الْاَوْصِيَاۤءَ مِنْ عِتْرَتِهِ بَعْدَ قَاۤئِمِهِمْ وَ غَيْبَتِهِ حَتّٰى يُدْرِكُوْا الْاَوْتَارَ وَ يَثْاَرُوْا الثَّارَ وَ يَرْضُوْا الْجَبَّارَ وَ يَكُوْنُوْا خَيْرَ اَنْصَارٍ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مَعَ اخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَ النَّهَارِ اَللّٰهُمَّ فَبِحَقِّهِمْ اِلَيْكَ اَتَوَسَّلُ وَ اَسْاَلُ سُؤَالَ مُقْتَرِفٍ مُعْتَرِفٍ مُسِيْۤ‏ءٍ اِلٰى نَفْسِهِ مِمَّا فَرَّطَ فِيْ يَوْمِهِ وَ اَمْسِهِ يَسْاَلُكَ الْعِصْمَةَ اِلٰى مَحَلِّ رَمْسِهِ، اَللّٰهُمَّ فَصَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ عِتْرَتِهِ وَ احْشُرْنَا فِيْ زُمْرَتِهِ وَ بَوِّئْنَا مَعَهُ دَارَ الْكَرَامَةِ وَ مَحَلَّ الْاِقَامَةِ اَللّٰهُمَّ وَ كَمَا اَكْرَمْتَنَا بِمَعْرِفَتِهِ فَاَكْرِمْنَا بِزُلْفَتِهِ وَ ارْزُقْنَا مُرَافَقَتَهُ وَ سَابِقَتَهُ وَ اجْعَلْنَا مِمَّنْ يُسَلِّمُ لِاَمْرِهِ وَ يُكْثِرُ الصَّلَاةَ عَلَيْهِ عِنْدَ ذِكْرِهِ وَ عَلٰى جَمِيْعِ اَوْصِيَاۤئِهِ وَ اَهْلِ اَصْفِيَاۤئِهِ الْمَمْدُوْدِيْنَ مِنْكَ بِالْعَدَدِ الْاِثْنٰي عَشَرَ النُّجُوْمِ الزُّهَرِ وَ الْحُجَجِ عَلٰى جَمِيْعِ الْبَشَرِ اَللّٰهُمَّ وَ هَبْ لَنَا فِيْ هٰذَا الْيَوْمِ خَيْرَ مَوْهِبَةٍ وَ اَنْجِحْ لَنَا فِيْهِ كُلَّ طَلِبَةٍ كَمَا وَهَبْتَ الْحُسَيْنَ لِمُحَمَّدٍ جَدِّهِ وَ عَاذَ فُطْرُسُ بِمَهْدِهِ فَنَحْنُ عَاۤئِذُوْنَ بِقَبْرِهِ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ نَشْهَدُ تُرْبَتَهُ وَ نَنْتَظِرُ اَوْبَتَهُ اٰمِيْنَ رَبَّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ۔--After that, you may say Dua al-Husayn (Supplicatory prayer of Imam al-Husayn), which is the last supplicatory prayer he said when his enemies surrounded him in large numbers on the Day of ‘Ashura (the tenth of Muharram):\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اَنْتَ مُتَعَالِيْ الْمَكَانِ عَظِيْمُ الْجَبَرُوْتِ شَدِيْدُ الْمِحَالِ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ الْخَلَایِقِ عَرِيْضُ الْكِبْرِيَاۤءِ قَادِرٌ عَلٰى مَا تَشَاۤءُ قَرِيْبُ الرَّحْمَةِ صَادِقُ الْوَعْدِ سَابِغُ النِّعْمَةِ حَسَنُ الْبَلَاۤءِ قَرِيْبٌ اِذَا دُعِيْتَ مُحِيْطٌ بِمَا خَلَقْتَ قَابِلُ التَّوْبَةِ لِمَنْ تَابَ اِلَيْكَ قَادِرٌ عَلٰى مَاۤ اَرَدْتَ وَ مُدْرِكٌ مَا طَلَبْتَ وَ شَكُوْرٌ اِذَا شُكِرْتَ وَ ذَكُوْرٌ اِذَا ذُكِرْتَ اَدْعُوْكَ مُحْتَاجًا وَ اَرْغَبُ اِلَيْكَ فَقِيْرًا وَ اَفْزَعُ اِلَيْكَ خَاۤئِفًا وَ اَبْكِيْۤ اِلَيْكَ مَكْرُوْبًا وَ اَسْتَعِيْنُ بِكَ ضَعِيْفًا وَ اَتَوَكَّلُ عَلَيْكَ كَافِيًا اُحْكُمْ بَيْنَنَا وَ بَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا [بِالْحَقِ‏] فَاِنَّهُمْ غَرُّوْنَا وَ خَدَعُوْنَا وَ خَذَلُوْنَا وَ غَدَرُوْا بِنَا وَ قَتَلُوْنَا وَ نَحْنُ عِتْرَةُ نَبِيِّكَ وَ وَلَدُ حَبِيْبِكَ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللّٰهِ الَّذِيْ اصْطَفَيْتَهُ بِالرِّسَالَةِ وَ ائْتَمَنْتَهُ عَلٰى وَحْيِكَ فَاجْعَلْ لَنَا مِنْ اَمْرِنَا فَرَجًا وَ مَخْرَجًا بِرَحْمَتِكَ يَاۤ اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔--Ibn ‘Ayyash has reported al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Sufyan al-Bazufi as saying that he heard Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) saying this supplicatory prayer on the third of Sha’ban, the birthday of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.).",

Abu’l-Qasim ibn ‘Ala’ al-HaMadani, the representative of Imam al-Hasan al-’Askari (a.s.), received a document telling that our master, Imam al-Husayn ibn Ali (a.s.), was born on the third of Sha’ban; therefore, you should observe fasting on this day and say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\nO Allah, I beseech You in the name of the one born on this day, the promised with martyrdom before the beginning of his lifetime and before his birth, the heavens and all their inhabitants wept for him; and so did the earth and those living one it before his feet stepped on it, the mourned slain one, the master of the Family (of Prophethood), the one who shall be backed with victory on the Day of Return, the one whom has been awarded the favor of the Imams’ being from his offspring as recompense of his being slain, the one awarded the favor of the soil of his grave carrying cure, the one awarded the favor that he will be triumphing when he will be returned and the Prophet’s Successors from his offspring will be returned after the advent of their Rising Imam and after his occultation so that they shall take revenge, retaliate, please the Omnipotent Lord, and be the best supporters. May Allah’s blessings be perpetually upon them whenever night and day succeed each other. O Allah, I thus beg You in the name of them and implore You with the imploration of a sinful one who confesses of his sin, and who has done evil to himself due to his violations— the past and the present. He thus beseeches You for Your protection up to the place of his grave. O Allah, (please) send blessings to Muhammad and his Offspring, include us with his group (on the Resurrection Day), and allow us to dwell in the House of Honor with him and in the abode of residence. O Allah, as You have conferred upon us with the honor of our recognition of him, so (please) confer upon us with the honor of being near to him, bestow upon us with the bliss of accompanying him _ and enjoying a close rank to him, and include us with those who submit to him totally and those who invoke Your blessings upon him whenever they mention him, and upon all his Successors and Selected Ones, whom are defined by You as twelve persons, being the luminous stars, and the Arguments against all humankind. O Allah, and (please) grant us on this day the best of grants, make all our prayers on this day responded, just as You gifted al-Husayn to Muhammad, his grandfather, just as the angel Futrus sought refuge with his (i.e. al-Husayn) cradle, we are thus seeking refuge with his tomb after him (i.e. his martyrdom), as we are witnessing the soil of him and expecting his return. Respond to us, O Lord of the worlds. \r\n\r\nAfter that, you may say Dua al-Husayn (Supplicatory prayer of Imam al-Husayn), which is the last supplicatory prayer he said when his enemies surrounded him in large numbers on the Day of ‘Ashura (the tenth of Muharram):\r\n\r\nO Allah, You are verily the Elevated in position, the Magnificent in omnipotence, the Mighty in prowess, the Self-Sufficient from the creatures, the Ample in pride, the Powerful over all that which You want, the Close in mercy, the Truthful in promise, the Opulent in favors, the Sympathetic in ordeals, the Nigh when Your are prayed, the All-encompassing of all that which You have created, the Accepter of the repentance of him who repents to You, the Powerful to do whatever You want, the Taker in all that which You decide, the Thankful for those who thank You, and the Rememberer of those who mention You. I pray You for I need You, I desire for You for I am in want of You, I resort to You for I am terrified, I weep before You for I am distressed, I seek Your aid for I am weak, and I depend upon You for I trust in none save You. (Please do) decide between our people and us with the truth, for they have deceived us, cheated us, disappointed us, betrayed us, and killed us. We are the progeny of Your Prophet and the sons of Your beloved one; namely, Muhammad the son of 'Abdullah, whom You have chosen for the Divine Mission and for keeping Your Revelation. So, (please) prepare a way out and a relief for us, out of Your mercy, O most Merciful of all those who show mercy! \r\n\r\nIbn ‘Ayyash has reported al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Sufyan al-Bazufi as saying that he heard Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) saying this supplicatory prayer on the third of Sha’ban, the birthday of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.)."
