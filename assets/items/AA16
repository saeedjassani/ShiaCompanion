    "content": "Numerous are the acts that are advisably practiced at the early dawn (fajr) times of Ramadan:\r\n\r\nFirst: It is highly advisably not to neglect having the early dawn (fajr) meal (suhur) even if a single date or a drink of water are had. The best food in the early dawn (fajr) meal is fine flour and dates. A Hadith reads that Almighty Allah and His angels bless those who implore for His forgiveness at the last hours of night and have the early dawn (fajr) meal.‚Äù\r\n\r\nSecond: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Qadr at early dawn (fajr) (sahar), for a Hadith reads that any believer who recites Surah al-Qadr at the early dawn (fajr) meal and the breaking the fast meal (iftar) will be decided as sacrificing his blood for the sake of Almighty Allah between these two times.",
