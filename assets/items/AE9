    "content": "In this respect, it seems appropriate to mention a few matters, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: According to an acceptable chain of authority, Imam ‘Ali al-Naqi (al-Hadi) is reported to have said, “Whoever has an urgent need to be granted by Almighty Allah, may visit the tomb of my grandfather al-Rida in Tus and, after bathing himself, offer a two-unit prayer at the side of his head and mention his need in the supplication (qunut) of the prayer. Doing so, his need will be granted unless it results in an act of disobedience to Him or a rupture of relations with the relatives. Verily, the place of his tomb is an area of Paradise. Any faithful believer who visits him will be saved from Hellfire and allowed to enter Paradise by Almighty Allah.”\r\n\r\nSALAT JA’FAR AT IMAM AL-RIDA’S TOMB\r\n\r\nSecond: ‘Allamah al-Majlisi has reported the following from a statement handwritten by the sublime Shaykh Husayn ibn ‘Abd al-Samad the father of Shaykh al-Baha’i:\r\n\r\nShaykh Abu’l-Tayyib Husayn ibn Ahmad al-Razi, the jurisprudent, has mentioned that whoever visits Imam al-Rida (‘a) or any other Imam and performs there the famous prayer known as Salat Ja’far, will have the reward of one who has gone on ritual hajj for thousand times, gone on ritual ‘umrah for one thousand times, manumitted one thousand slaves for the sake of Allah, and participated in a holy war with a missioned Prophet one thousand times for each unit of prayer he performs. For each step that he makes, he will be granted the reward of one hundred times of going on ritual hajj and one hundred times of going on ritual ‘umrah; and he will also gain the rewards of doing one hundred good deeds and one hundred punishable sins of him will be erased.\r\n\r\nThe method of Salat Ja’far has been previously cited in this book within the recommended acts on Fridays (pp. 160 of Vol. 1).",
