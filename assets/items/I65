It has been reported that Almighty Allah will reward the one who does so as many folds as the number of the dead persons in that graveyard.\r\n\r\nIn the book of Kamil al-Ziyarah, Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) is reported to have said, “If you visit your dead people before sunrise, they will hear and reply to you. If you visit them after sunrise, they will hear you but they will not reply you.”\r\n\r\nIn al-Rawandi’s book of al-Da’awat, there is a tradition reported from the Holy Prophet (s) entailing discommendation of visiting the dead at night. The Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said to Abu-Dharr, “Do not visit them frequently at night.”\r\n\r\nIn the collection of Shaykh al-Shahid, the Holy Prophet (s) is reported to have said: Whoever repeats the following words at a grave three times, Almighty Allah shall certainly remove from the dead person in that grave the chastisement on the Resurrection Day:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيۤ اَسْاَلُكَ بِحَقِّ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ اَنْ لَا تُعَذِّبَ هٰذَا الْمَيِّتَ--The following tradition is recorded in the book of Jami’ al-Akhbar as reported from one of the Holy Prophet’s companions:\r\n\r\nOne day, the Holy Prophet (s) said, “Give presents to your dead people.”\r\n\r\n“O Allah’s Messenger,” we asked, “what should we give as presents to our dead people?”\r\n\r\n“You should present them alms and supplications,” instructed the Holy Prophet (s).\r\n\r\nHe then added, “Every Friday, the souls of the believers come down to the lowest sky directly on their houses and homes and each one of them cry out with sad tone and weep, saying, ‘O my family members! O my sons! O my father! O my mother! O my relatives! Be kind to us, may Allah have mercy upon you, by presenting us some of that which was possessed by us! Now, woe and perdition are to us while the benefits are to others!’ Each one of the dead then cry out to his relatives, saying, ‘Be kind to us by giving as alms a dirham, a loaf of bread, or a dress so that Almighty Allah will dress you from the garments of Paradise.’”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s) then wept so heavily that he could not keep on talking. We also wept. He then added, “Those are your brothers-in-faith. They became rotten dust after pleasure and bliss. They now express grief and lamentation, saying, ‘Woe be to us! Had we given as alms all that which was possessed by us, seeking Almighty Allah’s pleasure and obeying Him, we would not have been in need for you.’ They then return with regret and grief, calling out, ‘Hurry up in giving the alms of the dead!’”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s) is also reported to have said, “Whatever alms you give on behalf of the dead, an angel will take that alms in a plate of light, while the alms is shining, to the seventh sky. He then stops at the brink of a ditch and says, ‘Peace be upon you, O inhabitants of the graves. Your people have gifted you this present.’ As the angel enters the grave with that alms, these graves are extended for their inhabitants. Verily, whoever dedicates an alms to a dead person will be given by Almighty Allah rewards that are as great as Mount Uhud. On the Resurrection Day, he will be placed under the shadow of Almighty Allah’s Throne when there shall be no shadow except Allah’s. Because of that alms, he will be saved in his lifetime and after his death.”\r\n\r\nIt has been told that the governor of Khurasan was seen in dream saying, “Send to me the leftovers that you give to the dogs, because I am in urgent need for these leftovers.”",
