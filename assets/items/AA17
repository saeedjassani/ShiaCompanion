It is sufficient, for the achievement of intention, to intend to observe fasting the next day for the sake of Almighty Allah and to abstain from having or doing any of the things or acts that break the fasting. It is also highly recommended not to neglect the famous Salat al-Layl (Night Prayer) and not to neglect the night worship.",
