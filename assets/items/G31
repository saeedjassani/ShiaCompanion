    "content": "As has been previously mentioned, one of the etiquettes of ziyarah is that the visitor, intending to leave for his hometown, should farewell to the visited person by saying the forms of bidding farewell that have been reported from the Holy Imams (‘a). It is noticeable that most of the forms of ziyarah end with statements of bidding farewell.\r\n\r\nAfter citing the forms of ziyarah of each of the Holy Imams, I have mentioned a form of bidding farewell to them. As to Imam al-Husayn, peace be upon him, I have also mentioned a form of bidding farewell to him as the twentieth etiquette of visiting him.\r\n\r\nHereinafter, I will cite another form of bidding farewell to the Holy Imams, which has been reported by Shaykh Muhammad al-Mashhadi in his book of al-Mazar al-kabir, Chapter: Bidding Farewell. The same form has been reported by Sayyid Ibn Tawus after the aforementioned comprehensive form of ziyarah known as Ziyarah of the Imams of the Believers.\r\n\r\nI will now cite it as exactly as it has been mentioned in the book of Misbah al-Za’ir:\r\n\r\nWhen you intend to bid farewell to and leave any of the holy shrines, you may say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا اَهْلَ بَيْتِ النُّبُوَّةِ وَ مَعْدِنَ الرِّسَالَةِ سَلَامَ مُوَدِّعٍ لَا سَئِمٍ وَ لَا قَالٍ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ اِنَّهُ حَمِيْدٌ مَجِيْدٌ سَلَامَ وَلِيٍّ غَيْرِ رَاغِبٍ عَنْكُمْ وَ لَا مُنْحَرِفٍ عَنْكُمْ وَ لَا مُسْتَبْدِلٍ بِكُمْ وَ لَا مُؤْثِرٍ عَلَيْكُمْ وَ لَا زَاهِدٍ فِيْ قُرْبِكُمْ لَا جَعَلَهُ اللّٰهُ اٰخِرَ الْعَهْدِ مِنْ زِيَارَةِ قُبُوْرِكُمْ وَ اِتْيَانِ مَشَاهِدِكُمْ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَ حَشَرَنِيَ اللّٰهُ فِي زُمْرَتِكُمْ وَ اَوْرَدَنِيْ حَوْضَكُمْ وَ اَرْضَاكُمْ عَنِّيْ وَ مَكَّنَنِيْ فِيْ دَوْلَتِكُمْ وَ اَحْيَانِيْ فِيْ رَجْعَتِكُمْ وَ مَلَّكَنِيْ فِيْۤ اَيَّامِكُمْ وَ شَكَرَ سَعْيِيْ لَكُمْ وَ غَفَرَ ذُنُوْبِيْ بِشَفَاعَتِكُمْ وَ اَقَالَ عَثْرَتِيْ بِحُبِّكُمْ وَ اَعْلٰى كَعْبِيْ بِمُوَالَاتِكُمْ وَ شَرَّفَنِيْ بِطَاعَتِكُمْ وَ اَعَزَّنِيْ بِهُدٰئكُمْ وَ جَعَلَنِيْ مِمَّنْ يَنْقَلِبُ مُفْلِحًا مُنْجِحًا سَالِمًا غَانِمًا مُعَافًا غَنِيًّا فَاۤئِزًا بِرِضْوَانِ اللّٰهِ وَ فَضْلِهِ وَ كِفَايَتِهِ، بِاَفْضَلِ مَا يَنْقَلِبُ بِهِ اَحَدٌ مِنْ زُوَّارِكُمْ وَ مَوَالِيْكُمْ وَ مُحِبِّيْكُمْ وَ شِيْعَتِكُمْ وَ رَزَقَنِيَ اللّٰهُ الْعَوْدَ ثُمَّ الْعَوْدَ ثُمَّ الْعَوْدَ مَاۤ اَبْقَانِيْ رَبِّيْ بِنِيَّةٍ صَادِقَةٍ وَ اِيْمَانٍ وَ تَقْوٰى وَ اِخْبَاتٍ وَ رِزْقٍ وَاسِعٍ حَلَالٍ طَيِّبٍ اَللّٰهُمَّ لَا تَجْعَلْهُ اٰخِرَ الْعَهْدِ مِنْ زِيَارَتِهِمْ وَ ذِكْرِهِمْ وَ الصَّلٰوةِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَ اَوْجِبْ لِيَ الْمَغْفِرَةَ وَ الرَّحْمَةَ وَ الْخَيْرَ وَ الْبَرَكَةَ وَ النُّوْرَ وَ الْاِيْمَانَ وَ حُسْنَ الْاِجَابَةِ كَمَاۤ اَوْجَبْتَ لِاَوْلِيَاۤئِكَ الْعَارِفِيْنَ بِحَقِّهِمُ الْمُوْجِبِيْنَ طَاعَتَهُمْ وَ الرَّاغِبِيْنَ فِيْ زِيَارَتِهِمُ الْمُتَقَرِّبِيْنَ اِلَيْكَ وَ اِلَيْهِمْ بِاَبِيْۤ اَنْتُمْ وَ اُمِّيْ وَ نَفْسِيْ وَ مَالِيْ وَ اَهْلِيْۤ اِجْعَلُوْنِيْ مِنْ هَمِّكُمْ وَ صَيِّرُوْنِيْ فِيْ حِزْبِكُمْ وَ اَدْخِلُوْنِيْ فِيْ شَفَاعَتِكُمْ وَ اذْكُرُوْنِيْ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَبْلِغْ اَرْوَاحَهُمْ وَ اَجْسَادَهُمْ عَنِّيْ تَحِيَّةً كَثِيْرَةً وَ سَلَامًا وَ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ",

I Offer you the salutation of one who has to bid farewell to you although he is neither bored with you nor tired of you. Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you, O People of the Household. He is verily worth of praise, full of glory. [I greet you] with the greeting of a loyalist to you who never forsakes you, never deviates from you, never substitutes you, never chooses others than you, and never becomes weary of being in your vicinity. May Allah never decide this time to be my last visit to your tombs and coming to your shrines. Peace be upon you all. May Allah include me with your group, allow me to come to your pond, make you to be pleased with me, give me authority in your (expected) government, restore me to life at your Return, grant me power on the days of your authority, thank my efforts for visiting you, forgive my sins through your intercession, absolve my slips on account of my love for you, raise my rank on account of my loyalty to you, endue me with honor due to my obedience to you, grant me dignity due to my following your right guidance, make me of those who return homes with success, prosperity, safety, profits, wellbeing, riches, and winning of Allah’s pleasure, favors, and security with the most favorable thing that any of your visitors, loyalists, lovers, and adherents may return with. May Allah grant me more and more chances to re-visit you, as long as my Lord keeps me alive, bearing honest intention, faith, piety, submission, and sustenance that is expansive, legally gotten, and pleasant. O Allah, do not decide this time to be my last visit to their tombs, mentioning them, and invoking blessings upon them. Make inevitable forgiveness, mercy, goodness, blessing, light, faith, and excellent response for me, just as You have made inevitable all that for Your intimate servants who recognize their actual status, who made obedience to them to be obligatory upon themselves, who have desire to visit them, and who seek nearness to You and to them. May my father, mother, soul, family members, and property be ransoms for you. (Please, O my masters,) include my issue with the matters of your concern, make me join your party, include me with your intercession, and remember me before your Lord. O Allah, (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and convey to their souls and bodies many greetings and salutations. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you all."
