Any prayer that is said in this situation will be definitely granted.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) said, “If you need something to be settled, you may go for seeking it on early Thursdays and you may recite the last verses of SurahAl-’Imran, Ayah al-Kursi, Surah al-Qadr, and Surah al-Faatehah before you leave your house, because these holy verses and Surahs contribute to solving all the needs for this life and the life to come.”",
