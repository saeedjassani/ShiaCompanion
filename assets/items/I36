    "content": "In his book of Taqwim al-Muhsinin, al-Muhaddith al-Kashani has mentioned special times in the week for practicing Istikharah with the Glorious Qurâ€™an, stating that these special times have been specified according to what is familiarly known by people, yet I have not found any tradition reported from the Ahl al-Bayt (a.s.) in this respect.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays, the suitable time for Istikharah is from the beginning of the day up to the noon and then from the afternoon up to sunset.\r\n\r\nOn Mondays, the suitable time is from the beginning of the day up to sunrise, from lunchtime to noon, and from afternoon to later evening.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesdays, the suitable time is from lunchtime to noon and from afternoon to later evening.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesdays, the suitable time is from the beginning of the day up to noon and from afternoon to later evening.\r\n\r\nOn Thursdays, the suitable time is from the beginning of the day up to sunrise and from noon up to later evening.\r\n\r\nOn Fridays, the suitable time is from the beginning of the day up to sunrise and from midday (zohr) to afternoon.\r\n\r\nOn Saturdays, the suitable time is from the beginning of the day up to lunchtime and from midday (zohr) to afternoon.\r\n\r\nThis table is quoted from the versified book of al-Madkhal by al-Muhaqqiq al-Tusi, may Allah purify the soil of his grave.",
