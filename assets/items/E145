O Hearer of all sounds! O He Who takes precedence over everything that passes away! 0 He Who revives all souls after death! (Please do) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of him and grant us, as well as all the believing men and women in the east and west of the earth, a relief from You that is immediate, by the creed that there is no god save Allah and that Muhammad is Your servant and Messenger— may Allah’s blessings be upon him, his Household, and his progeny; the infallible and pure, and may His thorough peace be upon them.
