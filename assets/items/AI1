It is narrated that the word tur-sinin (Holy Qur’an, 95/2) mentioned in the Holy Qur’an is an indication of this city. According to another narration, this city is the sanctuary of Almighty Allah, the Holy Prophet (s), and Imam ‘Ali (‘a), and to give one dirham as alms in this city is equal in rewarding to giving one hundred dirhams at other places, and to offer a two-unit prayer there is equal in rewarding to offering a hundred-unit prayer at other places.",
