    "content": "You should then hurry for performing the Sunset Prayer, because it is strongly discommended to postpone performing it at its earliest time. Actually, traditions have laid very much emphasis on warning against postponing performing the Sunset Prayer at its earliest time.\r\n\r\nWhen you intend to perform this prayer, you may utter the adhan and the iqamah statements observing the previously mentioned etiquettes. In the space of time between adhan and iqamah, you may say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّىْ اَسْئَلُكَ بِاِقْبَالِ لَيْلِكَ وَاِدْبَارِ نَهارِكَ وَحُضُوْرِ صَلَوَاتِكَ وَاَصْوَاتِ دُعاۤئِكَ وَتَسْبِيْحِ مَلَاۤئِكَتِكَ اَنْ تُصَلِّىَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّاٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَاَنْ تَتُوْبَ عَلَىَّ اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيْمُ۔--You may then perform the Sunset Obligatory Prayer, observing all of its etiquettes and meeting all of its conditions. Upon accomplishment, you may utter the Takbir statement three times and say Tasbih al-Zahra’. You may then say the following:\r\n\r\n--اِنَّ اللّٰهَ وَمَلَاۤئِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّوْنَ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ يَاۤ اَيُّهَا الَّذِيْنَ اٰمَنُوْا صَلُّوْا عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوْا تَسْلِيْمًا اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ النَّبِىِّ وَعَلٰى ذُرِّيَّتِهٖ وَعَلٰى اَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ۔--You may also repeat the following litany seven times:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔--You may also repeat the following doxology (zikr) three times:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِىْ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشاۤءُ وَلَا يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشاۤءُ غَيْرُهُ۔--You may also say the following imploration:\r\n\r\n--سُبْحَانَكَ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ اِغْفِرْ لِىْ ذُ نُوْبِىْ جَمِيْعًا فَاِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوْبَ كُلَّهَا جَمِيْعًا اِلَّا اَنْتَ۔--If you wish to say more post-prayer utterances, it is then favorable to delay saying them until you offer the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) sunset prayer, which consists of four units, each two separately (i.e. you say the Taslim statement after the second and fourth units). It is discommended to say anything (other than supplications) in the space of time between the obligatory and supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) sunset prayers. In the first unit of the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) prayer, you may recite Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Kafirun. In the second, you may recite Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Tawheed. In the third and fourth units, you may recite any Surah you wish although it is highly advisable to recite in the third unit Surah al-Faatehah and the following verses, which are the first six verses of Surah al-Hadid (No. 57):\r\n\r\nIt is also high advisable to recite in the fourth unit of the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) sunset prayer Surah al-Faatehah and the following holy verses, which are the last four verses of Surah al-Hashr (No. 59):\r\n\r\nJust like all other supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) prayers, it is acceptably sufficient to recite Surah al-Faatehah alone in each unit. It is highly advisable to recite the Surahs with audible voice, just like other supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) night prayers.\r\n\r\nRITES FOLLOWING THE supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) SUNSET PRAYER\r\n\r\nUpon accomplishing the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) sunset prayer, you may say any of the general post-prayer utterances. You may then do the thanksgiving prostration as has been previously cited. The least thing to be said in the thanksgiving prostration is the following:\r\n\r\n--شُكْرًا شُكْرًا شُكْرًا--Al-Kulayni has reported Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) as saying: When you finish the supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) sunset prayer, you may pass your hand over your forehead and repeat the following supplicatory prayer three times:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الَّذِىْ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا هُوَ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَ الشَّهَادَةِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمُ اَللّٰهُمَّ اَذْهِبْ‏ عَنِّىَ الْهَمَّ وَ الْحَزَنَ۔--It is highly advisable to offer the Ghufaylah Prayer (whose merits and method have been mentioned in the book of Mafatih al-Jinan) thereafter.",
