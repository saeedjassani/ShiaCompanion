    "content": "It has been narrated that because Friday nights are illustrious and daytimes are brilliant, you may repeat very often the litanies of subhanallah, Allahu-akbar, and la-Ilaha-illallah. You may also invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon Muhammad and his Household very frequently at this night.\r\n\r\nAccording to another narration, one may repeat the invocation of blessings upon Muhammad and his Household one hundred times at least at Friday nights. Yet, the more the best.\r\n\r\nImam al-Sadiq(a.s.) is reported as saying, “To invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon Muhammad and his Household at Friday nights is equal to winning one thousand rewards, having one thousand evildoings erased, and having one thousand ranks raised.”\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to start these invocations immediately after the Asr Prayer on Thursday up to the end of Friday daytime. In this regard, it has been authentically narrated that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said, “On Thursday afternoons, angels from the heavens descend to the lowest space carrying golden pens and silver papers on which they record nothing except the invocations of blessings upon Muhammad and his Household.\"\r\n\r\nShaykh al-Tusi says it recommended, on Thursdays, to repeat the invocations of blessings upon Muhammad and his Household one thousand times in the following form:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ عَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ وَ اَهْلِكْ عَدُوَّهُمْ مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَ الْاِنْسِ مِنَ الْاَوَّلِيْنَ وَ الْاٰخِرِيْنَ۔--Great reward will be the share of him who utters this invocation from Thursday afternoons up to the last hour of Fridays.",
