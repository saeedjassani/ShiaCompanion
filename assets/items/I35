    "content": "The sublime and well-versed jurisprudent, the author of Jawahir al-Kalam, says: There is another method of Istikharah practiced by some people of this age and probably ascribed to our master, the Rising Imam, may Allah hasten his reappearance: You may grasp a rosary from two ends randomly and pull each eight beads together after you say some holy verses and a supplication. If the remaining (to the other end) is one bead, this means that it is good in general. If two beads remain, this is an indication of warning against doing what you have intended to do. If three beads remain, then you have the choice to do or not to do. If four beads remain, then this is double warning. If fives beads remain, then the mission will be tiresome (according to some scholars) or blameworthy (according to others). If six beads remain, this means that the matter is utterly good to do and it must be done as soon as possible. If seven beads remain, the matter is as same as the remaining of five beads. If eight beads remain, this means that warning is extremely confirmed.",
