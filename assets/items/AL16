He then said: Attached to this chapter are the Supplication of Lamentation (Du’a’ al-Nudbah), the ziyarah form that is said every day after the Fajr (dawn (fajr)) Prayer, which is the seventh form of ziyarah, the supplication known as Du’a’ al-’Ahd (Supplication of the Covenant) which we have been ordered to say in the Occultation Age, and the prayer that is said when we intend to leave that holy sanctuary.\r\n\r\nSayyid Ibn Tawus then starts mentioning these rites. Patterning after him, let us mention these rites in this blessed book:",
