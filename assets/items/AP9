Rather, I will mention no more than the foresaid forms. As a matter of fact, the most favorable form of ziyarah, in the words of ‘Allamah al-Majlisi and other scholars, is the so-called al-Ziyarah al-Jami’ah (the comprehensive), which will be cited in this book.\r\n\r\nIn the first section of this book, I have cited other forms of ziyarah of Imam al-Hasan (‘a) on Mondays and the three Imams (‘a) altogether on Tuesdays. Therefore, ignore not these forms.\r\n\r\nAlthough I usually mention a form of invocation of blessings along with the forms of ziyarah that are relegated to each Imam, I have not mentioned such a form for the Holy Imams (‘a) whom are buried at al-Baqi’ Cemetery. Rather, I will mention such a form at the end of this section of Ziyarahs. Therefore, refer to it there so that you will add to your good deeds and increase your rewards through invoking Almighty Allah’s blessings on these immaculate Imams (‘a).",
