This is blessed and useful way.\r\n\r\nIt is narrated that a man complained to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) about colitis from which his brother had suffered. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) instructed, “Tell your brother to drink a mixture of honey and hot water.” The next day, the man returned to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and informed that the prescription was not useful. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) commented, “Allah is truthful, but your brother’s colon is not. Go back, give him the same drink, and recite on it Surah al-Faatehah seven times as prayer for God’s protection.” When the man left, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said to Imam Ali(a.s.), “The brother of this man is hypocrite; therefore, the drink was not effective with him.”",
