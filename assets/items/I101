They therefore complained to him about the many ailments from which they were suffering. Prophet Jesus (‘a) said to them, “This is because you eat the meat of camels before you wash it. No animal departs this life unless impurity associates it.” When they followed his instruction and started washing the meat before they would cook it, they recovered their health and got rid of the past ailments.”\r\n\r\nPassing by another village, Prophet Jesus (‘a) noticed that the teeth of its inhabitants were decayed and their faces were swollen. He thus said to them, “When you sleep, keep your mouths open and do not shut them.” As they followed his instruction, their disease disappeared.",
