Then, the ache would disappear.\r\n\r\nFor those who suffer from headache, while rubbing their heads with the hands, the following holy verse should be recited:\r\n\r\n--اِنَّ اللّٰهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَ الْاَرْضَ اَنْ تَزُوْلَا وَ لَئِنْ زَالَتَا اِنْ اَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ اَحَدٍ مِّنْ بَعْدِهِ اِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيْمًا غَفُوْرًا۔--The following incident is quoted from the book of Rabi’ al-Abrar:\r\n\r\nIn Turtus (a city western Syria), Al-Ma’mun, the ‘Abbasid ruler, was once affected by headache that none could treat. Having heard about this, the Roman emperor sent him a bonnet and a letter in which he wrote, “Having been informed about your headache, I sent you this bonnet so that you would put it on your head and your ache would vanish.” Anticipating that the bonnet would be poisoned, al-Ma’mun ordered the messenger to put it on his head. However, no harm happened to the messenger. Al-Ma’mun then ordered the bonnet to be put on the head of another man who suffered from headache. Therefore, his pain vanished. Only then did he put it on his head and his headache vanished. Surprised, al-Ma’mun untied the bonnet and found the following inscription written therein:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ كَمْ مِنْ نِعْمَةٍ لِلّٰهِ فِىْ عِرْقٍ سَاكِنٍ حٰمٓ عٓسٓقٓ لَا يُصَدَّعُوْنَ عَنْهَا وَلَا يُنْزِفُوْنَ مِنْ كَلَامِ الرَّحْمٰنِ خَمَدَتِ النِّيْرَانُ وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ وَ جَالَ نَفْعُ الدَّوَاۤءِ فِيْكَ كَمَا يَجُوْلُ مَاۤءُ الرَّبِيْعِ فِى الْغُصْنِ۔",
