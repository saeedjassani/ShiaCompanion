    "content": "(J)AAMAL OF THE DAY OF MAB'AS (27TH DAY)\r\n\r\nThis day is one of the great feast days. On this day, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was appointed for conveying the Divine Mission when Archangel Gabriel first came to him with the Divine Revelation. Several rites are advisably practiced on this day. Some of them are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: It is recommended to bathe oneself on this day.\r\n\r\nSecond: It is recommended to observe fasting. In fact, this day is one of the four days that are dedicated to fasting in the whole year. The reward of observing fasting on this day is equal to seventy year fasting.\r\n\r\nThird: It is recommended to repeat very frequently the invocation of blessings upon Prophet Muhammad and his Household.\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to visit the tombs of the Holy Prophet and Imam Ali, peace be upon them and their Household.\r\n\r\nFifth: In his book entitled Misbah al-Mutahajjid, Shaykh al-Tusi mentions that al-Rayyan ibn al-Salt is reported as saying that Imam Muhammad al-Jawad(a.s.) observed fasting on the fifteenth and the twenty-seventh of Rajab while he was in Baghdad. Following him, all of his followers observed fasting. He then ordered us to offer the prayer that consists of twelve units at each of which Surah al-Faatehah and another Surah should be recited. At the accomplishment of this prayer, it is recommended to recite Surahs al-Faatehah, al-Tawheed, al-Falaq, and al-Nas each for times. Then it is recommended to say the following litany four times:\r\n\r\n--لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَ اللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ وَ سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔--Then, it is recommended to repeat the following four times:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُ اَللّٰهُ رَبِّي لَا اُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئًا۔--Then, it is recommended to say the following four times, too:\r\n\r\n--لَا اُشْرِكُ بِرَبِّي اَحَدًا۔--Sixth: Shaykh al-Tusi has also reported Abu’l-Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh - may Allah have mercy upon him - as saying: On this day, you may offer a prayer consisting of twelve units at each of which you may recite Surah al-Faatehah and any other Surah. After each couple of units, you may say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِيْ لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَدًا وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ شَرِيْكٌ فِي الْمُلْكِ وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ وَلِيٌّ مِنَ الذُّلِّ وَ كَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيْرًا يَا عُدَّتِيْ فِي مُدَّتِيْ يَا صَاحِبِيْ فِي شِدَّتِيْ يَا وَلِيِّيْ فِي نِعْمَتِيْ يَا غِيَاثِيْ فِي رَغْبَتِيْ يَا نَجَاحِيْ فِي حَاجَتِيْ يَا حَافِظِيْ فِي غَيْبَتِيْ يَا كَافِيَّ فِي وَحْدَتِيْ يَا اُنْسِيْ فِي وَحْشَتِيْ اَنْتَ السَّاتِرُ عَوْرَتِيْ فَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ وَ اَنْتَ الْمُقِيْلُ عَثْرَتِيْ فَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ وَ اَنْتَ الْمُنْعِشُ صَرْعَتِيْ فَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اسْتُرْ عَوْرَتِي وَ اٰمِنْ رَوْعَتِي وَ اَقِلْنِيْ عَثْرَتِيْ وَ اصْفَحْ عَنْ جُرْمِيْ وَ تَجَاوَزْ عَنْ سَيِّئَاتِيْ فِي اَصْحَابِ الْجَنَّةِ وَعْدَ الصِّدْقِ الَّذِيْ كَانُوْا يُوْعَدُوْنَ۔--When you accomplish the prayer, you should recite Surahs al-Faatehah, al-Tawheed, al-Falaq, al-Nas, al-Kafirun, al-Qadr, and Ayah al-Kursi seven times. You should then repeat the following seven times:\r\n\r\n--لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَ اللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ وَ سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ۔--You should then say the following seven times:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُ اَللّٰهُ رَبِّي لَا اُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئًا۔--After that, you may submit your needs.\r\n\r\nSeventh: As is mentioned in Iqbal al-A’mal and some manuscripts of Misbah al-Mutahajjid, it is recommended to say the following supplicatory prayer on this day:\r\n\r\n--يَا مَنْ اَمَرَ بِالْعَفْوِ وَ التَّجَاوُزِ وَ ضَمَّنَ نَفْسَهُ الْعَفْوَ وَ التَّجَاوُزَ يَا مَنْ عَفَا وَ تَجَاوَزَ اعْفُ عَنِّيْ وَ تَجَاوَزْ يَا كَرِيْمُ اَللّٰهُمَّ وَ قَدْ اَكْدَى الطَّلَبُ وَ اَعْيَتِ الْحِيْلَةُ وَ الْمَذْهَبُ وَ دَرَسَتِ الْاٰمَالُ وَ انْقَطَعَ الرَّجَاءُ اِلَّا مِنْكَ وَحْدَكَ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَكَ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّي اَجِدُ سُبُلَ الْمَطَالِبِ اِلَيْكَ مُشْرَعَةً وَ مَنَاهِلَ الرَّجَاۤءِ لَدَيْكَ مُتْرَعَةً وَ اَبْوَابَ الدُّعَاۤءِ لِمَنْ دَعَاكَ مُفَتَّحَةً وَ الْاِسْتِعَانَةَ لِمَنِ اسْتَعَانَ بِكَ مُبَاحَةً وَ اَعْلَمُ اَنَّكَ لِدَاعِيْكَ بِمَوْضِعِ اِجَابَةٍ وَ لِلصَّارِخِ اِلَيْكَ بِمَرْصَدِ اِغَاثَةٍ وَ اَنَّ فِي اللَّهْفِ اِلٰى جُوْدِكَ وَ الضَّمَانِ بِعِدَتِكَ عِوَضًا مِنْ مَنْعِ الْبَاخِلِيْنَ۔ وَ مَنْدُوْحَةً عَمَّا فِيْ اَيْدِي الْمُسْتَاْثِرِيْنَ وَ اَنَّكَ لَا تَحْتَجِبُ عَنْ خَلْقِكَ اِلَّا اَنْ تَحْجُبَهُمُ الْاَعْمَالُ دُوْنَكَ وَ قَدْ عَلِمْتُ اَنَّ اَفْضَلَ زَادِ الرَّاحِلِ اِلَيْكَ عَزْمُ اِرَادَةٍ يَخْتَارُكَ بِهَا وَ قَدْ نَاجَاكَ بِعَزْمِ الْاِرَادَةِ قَلْبِيْ وَ اَسْاَلُكَ بِكُلِّ دَعْوَةٍ دَعَاكَ بِهَا رَاجٍ بَلَّغْتَهُ اَمَلَهُ اَوْ صَارِخٌ اِلَيْكَ اَغَثْتَ صَرْخَتَهُ اَوْ مَلْهُوْفٌ مَكْرُوْبٌ فَرَّجْتَ كَرْبَهُ اَوْ مُذْنِبٌ خَاطِئٌ غَفَرْتَ لَهُ اَوْ مُعَافًى اَتْمَمْتَ نِعْمَتَكَ عَلَيْهِ اَوْ فَقِيْرٌ اَهْدَيْتَ غِنَاكَ اِلَيْهِ وَ لِتِلْكَ الدَّعْوَةِ عَلَيْكَ حَقٌّ وَ عِنْدَكَ مَنْزِلَةٌ اِلَّا صَلَّيْتَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ قَضَيْتَ حَوَآئِجِيْ حَوَآئِجَ الدُّنْيَا وَ الْاٰخِرَةِ وَ هَذَا رَجَبٌ الْمُرَجَّبُ الْمُكَرَّمُ الَّذِيْ اَكْرَمْتَنَا بِهِ اَوَّلُ اَشْهُرِ الْحُرُمِ اَكْرَمْتَنَا بِهِ مِنْ بَيْنِ الْاُمَمِ يَا ذَا الْجُوْدِ وَ الْكَرَمِ فَنَسْاَلُكَ بِهِ وَ بِاسْمِكَ الْاَعْظَمِ الْاَعْظَمِ الْاَعْظَمِ الْاَجَلِّ الْاَكْرَمِ الَّذِيْ خَلَقْتَهُ فَاسْتَقَرَّ فِي ظِلِّكَ فَلَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْكَ اِلٰى غَيْرِكَ اَنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ الطَّاهِرِيْنَ وَ تَجْعَلَنَا مِنَ الْعَامِلِيْنَ فِيْهِ بِطَاعَتِكَ وَ الْاٰمِلِيْنَ فِيْهِ بِشَفَاعَتِكَ۔ اَللّٰهُمَّ وَ اهْدِنَا اِلٰى سَوَاءِ السَّبِيْلِ وَ اجْعَلْ مَقِيْلَنَا عِنْدَكَ خَيْرَ مَقِيْلٍ فِي ظِلٍّ ظَلِيْلٍ فَاِنَّكَ حَسْبُنَا وَ نِعْمَ الْوَكِيْلُ وَ السَّلَامُ عَلٰى عِبَادِهِ الْمُصْطَفَيْنَ وَ صَلَوَاتُهُ عَلَيْهِمْ اَجْمَعِيْنَ اَللّٰهُمَّ وَ بَارِكْ لَنَا فِي يَوْمِنَا هٰذَا الَّذِيْ فَضَّلْتَهُ وَ بِكَرَامَتِكَ جَلَّلْتَهُ وَ بِالْمَنْزِلِ الْاَعْلٰى اَنْزَلْتَهُ صَلِّ عَلٰى مَنْ فِيْهِ اِلٰى عِبَادِكَ اَرْسَلْتَهُ وَ بِالْمَحَلِّ الْكَرِيْمِ اَحْلَلْتَهُ اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ صَلَاةً دَاۤئِمَةً تَكُوْنُ لَكَ شُكْرًا وَ لَنَا ذُخْرًا وَ اجْعَلْ لَنَا مِنْ اَمْرِنَا يُسْرًا وَ اخْتِمْ لَنَا بِالسَّعَادَةِ اِلٰى مُنْتَهَىٰ اٰجَالِنَا وَ قَدْ قَبِلْتَ الْيَسِيْرَ مِنْ اَعْمَالِنَا وَ بَلَّغْتَنَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ اَفْضَلَ اٰمَالِنَا اِنَّكَ عَلٰى كُلِّ شَيْ‏ءٍ قَدِيْرٌ وَ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِهِ وَ سَلَّمَ۔--It is worth mentioning that this supplicatory prayer, which is one of the excellent supplications of Rajab, was said by Imam Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kazim (a.s.) on the day when the ruling authorities took him to Baghdad.

After each couple of units, you may say the following:\r\n\r\nAll praise is due to Allah, Who has not taken a son Who has not a partner in the kingdom, and Who has not a helper to save Him from disgrace; and proclaim His greatness with thorough proclamation. O my Supporter throughout my lifetime! O my Companion in hardships! O provider of me with all graces that I enjoy! O my Succor in my desires! O source of success of my needs! O my guardian while I am absent! 0 He Who is sufficient for me when I am alone! O my entertainment in my loneliness! You alone conceal my faults! So, all praise be to You. You alone overlook my slips. So, all praise be to You. You alone revive my deterioration. So, all praise be to You. (Please do) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and conceal my defects, secure my apprehensions, oversee my slips, pardon my offenses, overlook my evildoings, and include me with the people of Paradise; the promise of truth which they were promised. \r\n\r\nWhen you accomplish the prayer, you should recite Surahs al-Faatehah, al-Tawheed, al-Falaq, al-Nas, al-Kafirun, al-Qadr, and Ayah al-Kursi seven times.

O He Who did forgive and overlook! (Please do) forgive me and overlook (my evildoings), O All-generous! O Allah, surely all requests have been rejected, all means and ways have been inaccessible, all hopes have been eradicated, all expectations have been cut off from everybody save You alone. There is no partner with You. O Allah, I find the ways to requesting from You wide open, the springs of hoping for You quenching, the doors of supplication unlocked before one who implores You, and Your aid available for those who seek it. I also know that You are in the position of response for one who beseeches You, in the position of relief for one who resorts to You, and hastening to Your magnanimity and reliance upon Your promise compensate from the stinginess of the misery ones and suffice from that which is grasped by the mean ones. [I know for sure] that You never screen Yourself against Your beings, but it is their evildoings that prevent them from journeying toward You. I have also known for sure that the best provisions of one who intends to travel to You is a true willpower by which one chooses You from amongst Others. Hence, my heart has called at You with full willpower, and I pray You in the name of all supplications said by a hopeful and thus You have achieved his hope, said by a seeker of aid and thus You have admitted his request, said by an aggrieved, depressed one and thus You have relieved him, said by a guilty sinner and thus You have forgiven him, said by a healthy one and thus You have perfected Your favors on him, or said by a poor one and thus You have conferred upon him with Your wealth; so, these supplications occupy a considerable position with You and enjoy a standing with You, I pray You to send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and grant all my requests for this world and the Next World. This is Rajab, the honored and dignified month, which You have honored us through it, being the first of the Sacred Months, and You have selected us for this honor among the other nations. O Lord of Magnanimity and Generosity! I thus beseech You by Your Name, the grandest, the grandest, the grandest, the most majestic, the most honorable, that You have created so that it has settled under Your Shadow and it thus shall never transfer to anyone other than You, to send blessings to Muhammad and his Household the immaculate and to include us, during this month, with those who practice acts of obedience to You and those who hope for Your admission. O Allah, (please do) lead us to the Right Path, choose for us the best resting-place with You, under a dense shade and abundant possession. Surely, You are Sufficient for us! Most Excellent are You, and in You do we trust! Peace be upon His servants, the chosen, and His blessings be upon them all. O Allah, (please do) bless us on this day that You have honored, covered with Your nobility, and implanted in the great and highest Dwelling. (Please do) send blessings to him whom You sent (as Your Messenger) to Your servants and whom You accommodated in the Noble Place. O Allah, send upon him blessing that is never-ending, being in the form of thanks to You and reward to us. And make easy for us all our affairs and make our end result, up to the last of our lives, pleasant after You accept our little deed and achieve for us all our hopes out of Your mercy. Verily, You have power over all things. May Allah bless and exalt Muhammad and his Household. \r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that this supplicatory prayer, which is one of the excellent supplications of Rajab, was said by Imam Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kazim (a.s.) on the day when the ruling authorities took him to Baghdad. That day was the twenty-seventh of Rajab.\r\n\r\nEighth: As is mentioned in Iqbal al-A’mal, it is recommended to say the following supplicatory prayer on this day:\r\n\r\nO Allah, I beseech You in the name of the Grandest Manifestation... \r\n\r\nThis supplicatory prayer has been previously mentioned, yet according to the narration of al-Kaf’ami, within the rites of the twenty-seventh night of Rajab.\r\n\r\nThe Last Day of the Rajab\r\n\r\nNarrations have mentioned that it is recommended to bathe oneself on this day and to observe fasting on it, which achieves the forgiveness of all sins, both the past and the future. It is also recommended to offer Salat Salman previously mentioned within the rites of the first of Rajab."
