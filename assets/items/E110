It is also discommended for those who follow a funeral to laugh or to utter nonsensical words.\r\n\r\nIn his book entitled al-Hilyah, ‘Allamah al-Majlisi, may Allah have mercy upon him, quotes the Holy Prophet (s) as saying, “Whoever performs a prayer for a deceased, seventy thousand angels will pray for him and Almighty Allah will forgive him his past and coming sins. If he remains until the deceased is buried and soil completely covers his grave, then he will be granted a carat of reward for each step he has made. One carat is equal to the weight of Mount Uhud.”\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (s) is also reported to have said, “Any faithful believer who performs a prayer for a deceased person will be awarded Paradise incumbently unless he is hypocrite or impious to the parents.”",
