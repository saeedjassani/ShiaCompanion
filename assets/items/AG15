I have therefore quoted this form of ziyarah from this honorable book without leaning on any other means or reference book. Hence, the sealing statement of this form was the following:\r\n\r\n--فَيَا لَيْتَنِىْ كُنْتُ مَعَكُمْ فَاَفُوْزَ مَعَكُمْ‏--However, some books add the following statements thereafter:\r\n\r\n--فِىْ الْجِنَانِ مَعَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ وَ الصِّدِّيْقِيْنَ وَ الشُّهَدَاۤءِ وَ الصَّالِحِيْنَ وَ حَسُنَ اُوْلٰۤئِكَ رَفِيْقًا۔ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلٰى مَنْ كَانَ فِىْ الْحَاۤئِرِ مِنْكُمْ وَ عَلٰى مَنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِىْ الْحَاۤئِرِ مَعَكُمْ۔۔۔۔--These surplus statements and their likes are considered excessive,since they have not been mentioned in the reporter traditions; therefore, they are fabrications that have been forged against the traditions of the Holy Imams.",
