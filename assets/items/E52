Therefore, the Holy Prophet (s) taught him these words:\r\n\r\n--يَا حَىُّ يَا قَيُّوْمُ،يَا لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّاۤ اَنْتَ اَسْاَلُكَ اَنْ تُحْيِىَ قَلْبِىْۤ،اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ--The man commented, “When I repeated these words three times, Almighty Allah refreshed my heart.”",
