According to ‘Allamah al-Majlisi, it is preferable to perform the bathing at sunset so as to be ready for the Isha’ Prayer with a bathing.\r\n\r\nSecond: It is recommended to offer a two unit prayer reciting at each unit Surah al-Faatehah once and repeating Surah al-Tawheed seven times. After the accomplishment of the prayer, the following imploration should be repeated seventy times:\r\n\r\n--اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ واَتُوبُ اِلَيْهِ--According to a Hadith reported from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), Almighty Allah will forgive one who offers this prayer and will forgive his parents before he leaves his place.\r\n\r\nThird: It is recommended to open a copy of the Holy Qur’an between one’s hands and say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّي اَسْاَلُكَ بِكِتَابِكَ الْمُنْزَلِ وَمَا فِيْهِ وَفِيْهِ اسْمُكَ الْاَكْبَرُ وَاَسْمَآؤُكَ الْحُسْنٰى، وَمَا يُخَافُ وَيُرْجٰى اَنْ تَجْعَلَنِيْ مِنْ عُتَقَآئِكَ مِنَ النَّارِ۔--Then, one may pray God to fulfill one’s desires.\r\n\r\nFourth: It is recommended to put a copy of the Holy Qur’an on the head and say the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ بِحَقِّ هَذَا الْقُرْاٰنِ، وَبِحَقِّ مَنْ اَرْسَلْتَهُ بِهِ، وَبِحَقِّ كُلِّ مُؤْمِنٍ مَدَحْتَهُ فِيْهِ، وَبِحَقِّكَ عَلَيْهِمْ، فَلَا اَحَدَ اَعْرَفُ بِحَقِّكَ مِنْكَ--Then, one should repeat each of the following ten times:\r\n\r\n--بِكَ يَااَللهُ بِمُحَمَّدٍ بِعَلِيٍٍّ بِفَاطِمَةَ بِالْحَسَنِ بِالْحُسَيْنِ بِعَلِي بْنِ الْحُسَيْنِ بِمُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ بِجَعْفَرِ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ بِمُوْسَى بْنِ جَعْفَرٍ بِعَلِيِّ بْنِ مُوسٰى بِمُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ بِعَلِيِّ بْنِ مُحَمَّدٍ بِالْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ بِالْحُجَّةِ--One should then pray Almighty Allah to fulfill one’s desires.\r\n\r\nFifth: It is advisable to visit the holy tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s.) at these nights. A Hadith, in this respect, reads that at the Qadr Nights, a caller from the heavens will call from the Seventh Sky and, specifically, from the centre of the Holy Throne that Almighty Allah shall forgive whoever visits the tomb of al-Husayn (a.s.).\r\n\r\nSixth: It is highly advisable to spend the whole three Qadr Nights with acts of worship. A Hadith reads that one who spends the whole Qadr Nights with acts of worship will have all his sins forgiven even if they are as many as stars, as heavy as mountains, and as weighty as seawater.\r\n\r\nSeventh: In order to win its remarkable reward, it is recommended to offer the one hundred unit prayer. It is preferable to recite at these units Surah al-Faatehah once and repeat Surah al-Tawheed ten times.\r\n\r\nEighth: It is recommended to say the following supplicatory prayer:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّي اَمْسَيْتُ لَكَ عَبْدًا دَاخِرًا لَا اَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِيْ نَفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا، وَلَا اَصْرِفُ عَنْهَا سُوٓءًا، اَشْهَدُ بِذٰلِكَ عَلٰى نَفْسِيْ، وَاَعْتَرِفُ لَكَ بِضَعْفِ قُوَّتِيْ، وَقِلَّةِ حِيْلَتِيْ، فَصَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَاٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وَاَنْجِزْ لِيْ مَا وَعَدْتَنِيْ وَجَمِيْعَ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ مِنَ الْمَغْفِرَةِ فِيْ هٰذِهِ اللَّيْلَةِ، وَاَتْمِمْ عَلَيَّ مَا اٰتَيْتَنِيْ فَاِنِّيْ عَبْدُكَ الْمِسْكِيْنُ الْمُسْتَكِيْنُ الضَّعِيْفُ الْفَقِيْرُ الْمَهِيْنُ، اَللّٰهُمَّ لَا تَجْعَلْنِيْ نَاسِيًا لِذِكْرِكَ فِيْـمَا اَوْلَيْتَنِيْ، وَلَا لِاِحْسَانِكَ فِيْـمَا اَعْطَيْتَنِيْ، وَلَا اٰيِسًا مِنْ اِجَابَتِكَ وَاِنْ اَبْطَاَتَ عَنِّيْ، فِي سَرَّاۤءَ اَوْ ضَرَّاۤءَ، اَوْ شِدَّةَ اَوْ رَخَاۤءَ، اَوْ عَافِيَةٍ اَوْ بَلَاۤءٍ، اَوْ بُؤْسٍ اَوْ نَعْمَاۤءَ اِنَّكَ سَمِيْعُ الدُّعَاۤءِ۔--Al-Kaf’ami has narrated that Imam Zayn al-’Abidin(a.s.) used to say this supplicatory prayer very frequently at the Qadr Nights while sitting, standing, genuflecting, and prostrating.\r\n\r\n‘Allamah al-Majlisi has mentioned that the most favorable rite at the Qadr Nights is to implore for Almighty Allah’s forgiveness, to mention Him, to pray for the settlement of one’s worldly and religious affairs as well as for one’s parents, relatives, and brethren-in-faith; the dead and the alive, and to invoke blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household.\r\n\r\nAccording to some narrations, it is recommended to say the famous supplicatory prayer known as Dua al-Jawshan al-Kabir, which has been previously cited in this book, at the three Qadr Nights.\r\n\r\nIt has been also narrated that when he was asked about the best prayer that one may say at the Qadr Night, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said, “Pray for good health.”",
