Moreover, he shall be allowed to enter Paradise without being exposed to horror.”\r\n\r\nThe words by which Imam al-Husayn (‘a) is visited at the Qadr Night is a form of ziyarah mentioned by Shaykh al-Mufid, Muhammad ibn al-Mashhadi, Ibn Tawus, and al-Shahid, Allah’s mercy be upon them all, in their books on forms of ziyarah. They dedicated these forms to the ziyarah at this night and on the two day of ‘Id (i.e. ‘Id al-Fitr and ‘Id al-Azha).\r\n\r\nShaykh Muhammad ibn al-Mashhadi has reported, through considerable chains of authority, that Imam al-Sadiq (‘a) said the following:\r\n\r\nIf you want to visit Imam al-Husayn - at the Qadr Nights - you may come to his holy shrine after you wash yourself and put on the cleanest of your clothes. When you stop at his tomb, you may face it, making the kiblah direction between your shoulders, and say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا ابْنَ رَسُوْلِ اللّٰهِ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا ابْنَ اَمِيْرِ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا ابْنَ الصِّدِّيْقَةِ الطَّاهِرَةِ فَاطِمَةَ سَيِّدَةِ نِسَاۤءِ الْعَالَمِيْنَ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا مَوْلَايَ يَاۤ اَبَا عَبْدِ اللّٰهِ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ اَقَمْتَ الصَّلَاةَ وَ اٰتَيْتَ الزَّكَاةَ وَ اَمَرْتَ بِالْمَعْرُوْفِ وَ نَهَيْتَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَ تَلَوْتَ الْكِتَابَ حَقَّ تِلَاوَتِهِ وَ جَاهَدْتَ فِي اللّٰهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِ وَ صَبَرْتَ عَلَى الْاَذٰى فِي جَنْبِهِ مُحْتَسِبًا حَتّٰى اَتَاكَ الْيَقِيْنُ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ الَّذِيْنَ خَالَفُوْكَ وَ حَارَبُوْكَ وَ الَّذِيْنَ خَذَلُوْكَ وَ الَّذِيْنَ قَتَلُوْكَ مَلْعُوْنُوْنَ عَلٰى لِسَانِ النَّبِيِّ الْاُمِّيِّ وَ قَدْ خَابَ مَنِ افْتَرٰى لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ الظَّالِمِيْنَ لَكُمْ مِنَ الْاَوَّلِيْنَ وَ الْاٰخِرِيْنَ وَ ضَاعَفَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَذَابَ الْاَلِيْمَ اَتَيْتُكَ يَا مَوْلَايَ يَا ابْنَ رَسُوْلِ اللّٰهِ زَاۤئِرًا عَارِفًا بِحَقِّكَ مُوَالِيًا لِاَوْلِيَاۤئِكَ مُعَادِيًا لِاَعْدَاۤئِكَ مُسْتَبْصِرًا بِالْهُدَى الَّذِيۤ اَنْتَ عَلَيْهِ عَارِفًا بِضَلَالَةِ مَنْ خَالَفَكَ فَاشْفَعْ لِيْ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ۔--You may then throw yourself on the tomb, kiss it, put your cheek on it, move yourself towards the place of the head, and say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حُجَّةَ اللّٰهِ فِيۤ اَرْضِهِ وَ سَمَاۤئِهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلٰى رُوْحِكَ الطَّيِّبِ وَ جَسَدِكَ الطَّاهِرِ وَ عَلَيْكَ السَّلَامُ يَا مَوْلَايَ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ۔--You may again throw yourself on the tomb, kiss it, put your cheek on it, move yourself towards the place of the head, and offer the two-unit prayer of ziyarah after which you may offer any possible amount of prayer units. You may then turn to the side of the feet and visit ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn, saying:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا مَوْلَايَ وَ ابْنَ مَوْلَايَ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ مَنْ ظَلَمَكَ وَ لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ مَنْ قَتَلَكَ وَ ضَاعَفَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَذَابَ الْاَلِيْمَ۔--You may then pray Almighty Allah for your personal needs.\r\n\r\nThen, you may leave your place at the side of the feet towards the kiblah direction in order to visit the martyrs by saying:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَيُّهَا الصِّدِّيْقُوْنَ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَيُّهَا الشُّهَدَاۤءُ الصَّابِرُوْنَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمْ جَاهَدْتُمْ فِيْ سَبِيْلِ اللّٰهِ وَ صَبَرْتُمْ عَلَى الْاَذٰى فِيْ جَنْبِ اللّٰهِ وَ نَصَحْتُمْ لِلّٰهِ وَ لِرَسُوْلِهِ حَتّٰى اَتَاكُمُ الْيَقِيْنُ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمْ اَحْيَاۤءٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْزَقُوْنَ فَجَزَاكُمُ اللّٰهُ عَنِ الْاِسْلَامِ وَ اَهْلِهِ اَفْضَلَ جَزَاۤءِ الْمُحْسِنِيْنَ وَ جَمَعَ بَيْنَنَا وَ بَيْنَكُمْ فِي مَحَلِّ النَّعِيْمِ۔--You may then walk to the shrine of al-’Abbas the son of the Commander of the Faithful. When you stop at the gate of the shrine, you may say the following words:\r\n\r\n--اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا ابْنَ اَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الْعَبْدُ الصَّالِحُ الْمُطِيْعُ لِلّٰهِ وَ لِرَسُوْلِهِ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ جَاهَدْتَ وَ نَصَحْتَ وَ صَبَرْتَ حَتّٰى اَتَاكَ الْيَقِيْنُ لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ الظَّالِمِيْنَ لَكُمْ مِنَ الْاَوَّلِيْنَ وَ الْاٰخِرِيْنَ وَ اَلْحَقَهُمْ بِدَرَكِ الْجَحِيْمِ۔--You may offer there any amount of prayers voluntarily and then leave.",

Peace be upon you, O son of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O son of the veracious, immaculate lady Fatimah the Doyenne of the women of the world. Peace be upon you, O my master Abu-'Abdullah. So be upon you Allah’s mercy and blessings. I bear witness that you performed the prayers, defrayed the poor-rate, enjoined the right, forbade the wrong, recited the Book (i.e. the Holy Qur'an) as exactly as it should be recited, strove for the sake of Allah as exactly as striving must be, and faced all troubles steadfastly for His sake, seeking his reward, until death came upon you. I also bear witness that those who dissented you, those who fought against you, those who let you down, and those who slew you (all those) were accursed directly by the Meccan Prophet. And he who forges lies indeed fails to attain his desire. May Allah curse those who wronged you from amongst the past and the present generations. May Allah also double for them the painful torment. O my master and son of Allah’s Messenger, I have come to you visiting you, acknowledging the standing that you enjoy, declaring my loyalty to those who are loyal to you, renouncing your enemies, seeking to follow the true guidance that you are following, and recognizing the deviation of those who oppose you; so, (please)intercede for me before your Lord.\r\n\r\nYou may then throw yourself on the tomb, kiss it, put your cheek on it, move yourself towards the place of the head, and say the following words:\r\n\r\nPeace be upon you, O Argument of Allah in His lands and heavens.

Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O my master.\r\n\r\nYou may again throw yourself on the tomb, kiss it, put your cheek on it, move yourself towards the place of the head, and offer the twounit prayer of ziyarah after which you may offer any possible amount of prayer units.

Peace be upon you, O steadfast martyrs. I bear witness that you strove in the way of Allah, acted patiently against harm for the sake of Allah, and did sincerely for the sake of Allah and His Messenger until death came upon you. I bear witness that you are alive and are being provided sustenance from your Lord. May Allah reward you with the best reward of the good-doers on behalf of Islam and its people and may He join us to you in the abode of bliss.\r\n\r\nYou may then walk to the shrine of al’Abbas the son of the Commander of the Faithful.
