    "english": "Peace be upon you, O Abu'l-Fazl al-Abbas the son of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O son of the chief of the successors (of the Prophets). Peace be upon you, O son of the foremost to Islam, the first to believe, the best to have served the religion of Allah, and the most careful for Islam. I bear witness that you served Allah, His Messenger, and your brother sincerely. You were the most excellent self-sacrificing brother. So, Allah's curse be on the group who killed you. Allah's curse be on the group who wronged you. Allah's curse be on the group who violated your sanctities and infringed the sanctity of Islam. You were the most excellent steadfast fighter, protector, supporter, and brother who defended his brother, responded to the obedience to his Lord, and worked desirably for gaining the abundant reward, which others refused, and the nice tribute. So, Allah may attach you to the rank of your fathers in the gardens of bliss. O Allah, I have done the pilgrimage to Your disciples out of my desire for (winning) your reward and my wish for Your forgiveness and Your abundant benevolence. So, I implore You to send Your blessings upon Muhammad and his immaculate Household and to make my sustenance flow copiously in their names, my living delightful in their names, my pilgrimage rewardable in their names, and my life pleasant in their names, to make me take to the conduct of the honored ones, to make me one of those who, as returning from the pilgrimage to the tombs of Your beloved ones, win success and prosperity and deserve forgiveness of sins, covering up of defects, and relief of disasters. You are surely worthy of being feared and worthy of forgiving."
