This act doubles the reward of the prayer to four hundred folds. It is also advisable to break the fast with dates, ripe dates, candy, sugar-candy, and cool water.\r\n\r\nThird: It is recommended to say the familiar supplicatory prayers of breaking the fast, such as the following:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ لَكَ صُمْتُ، وَعَلٰى رِزْقِكَ اَفْطَرْتُ، وَعَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْتُ،--One who says this supplicatory prayer will be awarded, by Almighty Allah, the rewards of all those who observe fasting on that day.\r\n\r\nSayyid ibn Tawus and al-Kaf’ami have narrated the supplicatory prayer that begins with:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ رَبَّ النُّوْرِ الْعَظِيْمِ--This supplicatory prayer also brings about a great merit.\r\n\r\nIt has been narrated that Imam Ali(a.s.) used to say the following supplicatory prayer when he would break his fasting:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ اَللّٰهُمَّ لَكَ صُمْنَا وَعَلٰى رِزْقِكَ اَفْطَرْنَا فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنَّا اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ السَّمِيْعُ الْعَلِيْمُ۔--Fourth: It is recommended to say the following imploration for forgiveness at the first bite of the food with which the fasting is broken:\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ، يَا وَاسِعَ الْمَغْفِرَةِ اِغْفِرْ لِيْ۔--Forgiveness of Almighty Allah is the reward of those who say this imploration.\r\n\r\nA Hadith reads: Almighty Allah releases from Hellfire one million persons at the last hour of every day in Ramadan; therefore, pray Him to include you with these released ones.\r\n\r\nFifth: It is recommended to recite Surah al-Qadr at breaking the fast.\r\n\r\nSixth: It is recommended to give alms at the time of breaking the fast and to offer food to the other fasters even if with a single date and a drink of water. Concerning this, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) is reported to have said, “Verily, anyone who offers food for a faster in Ramadan will have the same reward that is decided for the faster without having any amount of his reward reduced and will have the same reward of acting good deeds according to the power of that food.”\r\n\r\n‘Allamah al-Hilli, in al-Risalah al-Sa’diyyah, has narrated that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said, “As for any believer who feeds another believer with a single bite of food in Ramadan, Almighty Allah will decide for him the reward of manumitting thirty believing slaves and will decide to respond to his prayers.”\r\n\r\nSeventh: Narrations have confirmed that it is advisable to recite Surah al-Qadr one thousand times a night.\r\n\r\nEighth: When possible, it is recommended to recite Surah al-Dukhan (No. 44) one hundred times a night.\r\n\r\nNinth: Sayyid ibn Tawus has mentioned that if one says the following supplicatory prayer each night in Ramadan, his sins of forty years will be forgiven:\r\n\r\n--اَللّٰهُمَّ رَبَّ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِيْ اَنْزَلْتَ فِيْهِ الْقُرْاٰنَ، وَافْتَرَضْتَ عَلٰى عِبَادِكَ فِيْهِ الصِّيَامَ، صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَاٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، وَارْزُقْنِيْ حَجَّ بَيْتِكَ الْحَرَامِ فِيْ عَامِيْ هٰذَا وَفِيْ كُلِّ عَامٍ، وَاغْفِرْ لِيْ تِلْكَ الذُّنُوْبَ الْعِظَامَ، فَاِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُهَا غَيْرُكَ يَا رَحْمٰنُ يَا عَلَّامُ۔--Tenth: It is recommended to say the previously mentioned supplicatory prayer known as Dua al-Hajj after the Maghrib Prayer.",
