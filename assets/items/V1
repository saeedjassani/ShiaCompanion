    "content": "It is proper to visit Lady Fatimah al-Zahra’(a.s.) and to hold consolation ceremonies on these three days, for it has been narrated that she lived after her father only seventy-five days. Accordingly, she must have departed life on one of these three days because the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) departed life on the twenty-eighth of Safar.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of Jumadi al Ula, AH 36, Imam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) conquered the city of al-Basrah. Also, Imam Zayn al-’Abidin(a.s.) was born on this day; therefore, it is proper to visit both the Imams (a.s.) on this day.",
