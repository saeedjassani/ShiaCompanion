    "content": "When you accomplish the prayer, you may begin with saying the post-prayer supplications, litanies, and doxologies (ta’qib), because traditions have laid much stress on these.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, Almighty Allah has said (in the Holy Qur’an):\r\n\r\n--فَاِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَانْصَبْ وَاِلٰى رَبِّكَ فَارْغَبْ۔--About the exegesis of these two holy verses, it is reported that when you accomplish your prayer, you should labor hard by engaging yourself with supplications and you should desire for your Lord by praying Him for granting you your requests and you should thus put your hope in none save Him.\r\n\r\nImam AliAmeer al-Momineen(a.s.) is reported to have said, “When you accomplish your prayers, you may raise your hands towards the sky and tire out yourself by praying Almighty Allah.”\r\n\r\nAs is inferred from traditions, post-prayer utterances increase sustenance. A believer is recorded as performer of prayers and is awarded the rewards of performing prayers as much as he engages himself with mentioning Almighty Allah after the prayer. A supplication that is said after obligatory prayers is preferred to supplications that are said after supererogatory (mustahab / nafilah) prayers.",
