    "content": "This supplicatory amulet is connected to a miraculous story that was reported by Abu’l-Salt who, reporting this story, has said: One day, my master ‘Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (‘a) was sitting in his house when a messenger of the ruler, al-Ma’mun, came to him and informed that the ruler had summoned him to present himself before him. ‘Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (‘a) stood up and said to me, “Abu’l-Salt, it is not usual that the ruler summons me at such time unless there will be a catastrophic matter. No, by Allah! He will not be able to inflict any misfortunate thing upon me, because I carry with me a few words that came to my hand from my grandfather, the Holy Prophet (s).”\r\n\r\nI, Abu’l-Salt, then came out with the Imam (‘a) to respond to al-Ma’mun’s summon. The moment Imam al-Rida’s eyes fell on al-Ma’mun, he said this supplicatory amulet entirely. When he was present there, the ruler looked at the Imam (‘a) and said, “Abu’l-Hasan, I have ordered one hundred thousand dirhams to be given to you. You may also write to me whatever you need.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Imam (‘a) left, al-Ma’mun looked at his back and said, “I wanted something, but Allah wanted another. However, what Allah wants must be better.”",
