    "content": "In Makarim al-Akhlaq, the following is quoted from Imam al-Baqir and Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.):\r\n\r\nWith a saffron liquid that is put in a clean vessel, you may write Surah al-Faatehah, Ayah al-Kursi, Surah al-Qadr, Surah Yasin, Surah al-Waqiah, Surah al-Hashr, Surah al-Mulk, Surah al-Tawheed, Surah al-Falaq, and Surah al-Nas, and wash the patch with water taken from Zamzam Spring, rainwater, or clean water. Then, you may put two mitigals  of olibanum (an aromatic gum formerly used in medicine but now chiefly as incense), ten mitigals of sugar, and ten mitigals of honey. You may then put it under sunlight and put a piece of iron on it. At the last hours of night, you may offer a two unit prayer in each unit of which you may recite Surah al-Faatehah and repeat Surah al-Tawheed fifty times. Upon accomplishment, you may drink that water, which is very useful and time-tested for strengthening memory, God willing.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Chapter Six, we will mention matters that strengthen memory.",
