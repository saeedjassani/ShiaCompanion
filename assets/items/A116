    "content": "SURAH AT-TAWHID (THE UNITY)\r\n\r\nThis Surah was revealed in Makkah and it has 4 verses. It is also known as Surah al-Ikhlaas. It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (S) that whoever recites this Surah once will get the reward equal to ten times the number of people who have believed in the Islamic teachings.\r\n\r\nThis Surah has many other rewards and its recitation is compared to reciting a third of the Holy Qur’an. Reciting it once is a means of blessings for the reciter, if recited twice then the blessings are also showered upon the children of the reciter. Reciting it thrice brings blessings on the entire family of the reciter. If Surah al-Ikhlas is recited 11 times, the reciter will have palaces built for him in Jannah.\r\n\r\nWhen a person recites this Surah 100 times, all his sins for the past 25 years are forgiven (except the sins of killing an innocent person or usurping the property of people). The one who recites it 1000 times will not die unless he sees his place in Jannah.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Prophet (S) once advised a poor person to always say ‘salaam’ when entering his house, even if there was nobody there, and then recite Surah at-Tawhid. After a little while, the man became abundantly wealthy.\r\n\r\nIt is narrated that if a person does not recite this Surah in any of his five daily prayers, it is as if he has not prayed. In fact, if a person does not recite this Surah in any of his prayers for seven consecutive days, and he dies, it will be as if he died while following the religion of Abu Lahab.\r\n\r\nIt is makruh to recite this Surah in one breath. This Surah has numerous other benefits and is a cure for many ailments. It should be recited when travelling or when facing a tyrant ruler.\r\n\r\n--بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ--قُلْ هُوَ اللّٰهُ اَحَدٌ‌ ۚ‏(1)--اَللّٰهُ الصَّمَدُ‌ ۚ‏(2)--لَمْ يَلِدْ   ۙ وَلَمْ يُوْلَدْ ۙ‏(3)--وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهٗ كُفُوًا اَحَدٌ ‏(4)",
