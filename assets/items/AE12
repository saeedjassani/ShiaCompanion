In that holy shrine, blind and leprous people were cured, prayers were responded, requests were granted, and intricate matters were relieved. We have certainly seen many examples of these miracles without doubt.”\r\n\r\nIn his book of Ithbat al-Hudat, the sublime Shaykh al-Hurr al-’Amili, after quoting the aforesaid statement of al-Tabrisi, says the following:\r\n\r\n“The author of this book, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Hurr, says: I myself have seen many of such miracles as Shaykh al-Tabrisi did and I have been certain of them as Shaykh al-Tabrisi was. That was during my neighborhood of the holy shrine for twenty-six years. I have also heard about such miracles in such a certain way that it exceeds the uninterruptability of the chains of authority. I cannot remember that I would not be granted any request that I prayed for in this holy shrine. All praise be to Allah for so. However, because details of this topic are too lengthy to be mentioned in this book, I am resorting to mentioning a summary of it.”",
