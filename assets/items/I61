The jinn devils can be dispelled by this saying:\r\n\r\n--لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔--The human devils can be dispelled by invoking Almighty Allah’s blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter, I have referred to a prayer offered for dispelling evil self-suggestions as well as some supplicatory amulets against devilish insinuations.",
