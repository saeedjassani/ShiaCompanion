This supplication is as follows:\r\n\r\n--يَا عِمَادَ مَنْ لَا عِمَادَ لَهُ وَ يَا ذُخْرَ مَنْ لَا ذُخْرَ لَهُ وَيَا سَنَدَ مَنْ لَا سَنَدَ لَهُ وَيَا حِرْزَ مَنْ لَا حِرْزَ لَهُ وَيَا غِيَاثَ مَنْ لَا غِيَاثَ لَهُ وَيَا كَنْزَ مَنْ لَا كَنْزَ لَهُ وَيَا عِزَّ مَنْ لَا عِزَّ لَهُ يَا كَرِيْمَ الْعَفْوِ يَا حَسَنَ التَّجَاوُزِ يَا عَوْنَ الضُّعَفاۤءِ يَا كَنْزَ الْفُقَرَاۤءِ يَا عَظِيْمَ الرِّجَاۤءِ يَا مُنْقِذَ الْغَرْقٰى يَا مُنْجِىَ الْهَلْكٰى يَا مُحْسِنُ، يَا مُجْمِلُ يَا مُنْعِمُ يَا مُفْضِلُ اَنْتَ الَّذِىْ سَجَدَ لَكَ سَوَادُ اللَّيْلِ وَنُوْرُ النَّهَارِ وَضَوْءُ الْقَمَرِ وَشُعَاعُ الشَّمْسِ وَحَفِيْفُ الشَّجَرِ وَدَوِىُّ الْمَاۤءِ يَاۤ اَللهُ يَاۤ اَللهُ يَاۤ اَللهُ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ وَحْدَكَ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَكَ يَا رَبَّاهُ يَاۤ اَللهُ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَافْعَلْ بِنَا مَا اَنْتَ اَهْلُهُ۔--You may then mention your personal needs.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the following supplicatory prayer is reported from Imam Muhammad al-Jawad(a.s.) who said that if it is recited regularly, it achieves relief and releases from grief and ordeals:\r\n\r\n--يَا مَنْ يَكْفِىْ مِنْ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَلَا يَكْفِىْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ اِكْفِنِىْ مَاۤ اَهَمَّنِىْ",

O He Who pardons excellently! 0 Helper of the weak! 0 Treasure of the poor! 0 He Who is greatly hoped! 0 Savior of the drowned! 0 Rescuer of the perishing! 0 All-munificent! 0 All- benign! 0 All-gracious! 0 All-benevolent! It is You alone before Whom the darkness of night has prostrated. So have the light of day, the brightness of the moon, the radiance of the sun, the rustle of trees, and the murmur of water. 0 Allah! 0 Allah! 0 Allah! There is no god save You; You are the One and Only without having any partner. 0 my Lord! 0 Allah! (Please do) bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and do to us all that which suits You. \r\n\r\nYou may then mention your personal needs.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the following supplicatory prayer is reported from Imam Muhammad al-Jawad (a.s.) who said that if it is recited regularly, it achieves relief and releases from grief and ordeals:\r\n\r\nO He Who protects against all things while nothing can ever stand against Him, (please do) save me from that which has aggrieved me.
