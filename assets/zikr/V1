Accordingly, she must have departed life on one of these three days because the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) departed life on the twenty-eighth of Safar.\nOn the fifteenth of Jumada al-Ula, AH 36, Imam Ali Ameer al-Momineen (a.s.) conquered the city of al-Basrah. Also, Imam Zayn al-’Abidin (a.s.) was born on this day; therefore, it is proper to visit both the Imams (a.s.) on this day.",
